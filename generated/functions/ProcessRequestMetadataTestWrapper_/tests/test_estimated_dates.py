    communication="""Dear Ms. Barghouty & Ms. Pickoff-White:

    As you know, this office serves as City Attorneys for the City of Clovis (“City”).  We are in receipt of your Public Records Act (“PRA”) request dated January 23, 2023.  Your request states that it seeks records pursuant to Senate Bills 1421 and 16 for police officer records under the categories identified by Penal Code section 832.7, subdivision (b), for the time period of January 1, 2014, to January 23, 2023.

    On March 17, 2023, the City provided you with “Batch 1” containing responsive, non-exempt documents.  On March 22, 2023, the City provided you with “Batch 2” containing additional responsive, non-exempt documents.  We informed you in our prior correspondence dated April 14, 2023, that the City would make all reasonable efforts to provide further responsive, non-exempt documents to you on a rolling basis in a manner consistent with the PRA by no later than May 19, 2023, provided that we would timely notify you if this was not possible.

    Accordingly, enclosed with the transmission of this correspondence, the City is providing you with further responsive, non-exempt, documents.  This additional set of documents will be referred to as “Batch 3.”  Please note that the City will not disclose information such as personal data, including home addresses or telephone numbers, to preserve the anonymity of family members, whistleblowers, complainants, victims, and witnesses.  (Pen. Code § 832.7, subd. (b)(6).)  Additionally, the City will not release any records which contain sensitive and private information that would constitute an unwarranted invasion of privacy and, therefore, the public interest served by not disclosing the records clearly outweighs the public interest served by disclosure.  (Pen. Code, § 832.7, subd. (b)(7); Gov. Code. § 7922.000.)  Accordingly, such information has been redacted from the documents produced.  Deputy City Attorney Matthew M. Lear is the party responsible for asserting the exemptions.

    Due to the volume of the remaining documents, the City is still in the process of preparing the raw audio/video footage for production.  The City will continue to produce these records on a rolling basis and will make all reasonable efforts to provide the requested records to you in a manner consistent with the PRA.  The City anticipates that it will be able to provide some, if not all, of these remaining documents by no later than June 16, 2023, provided that we will timely notify you if this is not possible.

    We thank you for your continued courtesy.  Please contact me if you have any questions.

    Sincerely,

    LOZANO SMITH

    Dear Mr. Delaware:
    This correspondence is in response to your email of May 26, 2023 requesting an estimated completion
    date for a FOIA request you have filed with the George W. Bush Presidential Library. That estimate is
    listed below. Our most recent estimate, sent to you on April 26, 2023, was the best estimate we had at that
    time. Currently, we are trying to make our best estimate; however, it is still an estimate. This estimate
    includes time for NARA to complete the necessary notification to the representatives of the former and
    incumbent Presidents in order to afford them an opportunity to conduct a privilege review, as is required
    by the Presidential Records Act (PRA).
    As stated in our letter dated April 27, 2017, request 2017-0330-F is in the complex unclassified electronic
    queue and there are 107 requests ahead of yours in this queue. Per NARA procedures, this request will be
    segmented due to its volume. We will review 10,000 assets and then this request will go to the end of the
    queue. Our best estimate at this time is that the first segment of this request may be completed in
    approximately 20 years from today.
    If you have any questions regarding your FOIA request, please contact our staff at 214-346-1557 or
    gwbush.library@nara.gov. Your FOIA case log number is 2017-0330-F. Please have this number
    accessible for reference during any future contact concerning this case.
