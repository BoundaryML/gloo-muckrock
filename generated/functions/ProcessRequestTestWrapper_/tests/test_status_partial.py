RE: Public Records Act Request under PC832.7 Dated February 13, 2023
The City of Barstow (the âCityâ) is currently processing your Public Records Act request received
February 21, 2023 regarding records subject to disclosure under Penal Code section 832.7.
Specifically, you requested:
1. INCIDENTS INVOLVING THE DISCHARGE OF A FIREARM: all incidents involving
discharge of a firearm at a person by a peace officer.
2. USE OF FORCE RESULTING IN DEATH OR GREAT BODILY INJURY: all records
relating to incidents where the use of force by a peace officer or custodial officer against a
person resulted in great bodily injury or death.
3. SUSTAINED FINDINGS OF SEXUAL ASSAULT: all records of incidents where a
sustained finding was made by any agency that a peace officer or custodial officer engaged
in sexual assault involving a member of the public.
4. SUSTAINED FINDINGS OF DISHONESTY: all records relating to incidents where a
sustained finding of dishonesty was made by any agency against a peace officer or
custodial officer.
5. SUSTAINED FINDINGS OF UNREASONABLE OR EXCESSIVE FORCE: all reports
of sustained findings involving a complaint that alleges unreasonable or excessive force.
6. SUSTAINED FINDING THAT AN OFFICER FAILED TO INTERVENE: all reports of
sustained findings that an officer failed to intervene against another officer using force that
is clearly unreasonable or excessive.
7. SUSTAINED FINDING OFFICER ENGAGED IN PREJUDICE OR
DISCRIMINATION: all records relating to incidents where a sustained finding of
prejudice or discrimination against a person on the basis of race, religious creed, color,
national origin, ancestry, physical disability, mental disability, medical condition, genetic
information, marital status, sex, gender identity, gender expression, age, sexual
orientation, or military and veteran status.

8. SUSTAINED FINDINGS OF UNLAWFUL ARREST OR CONDUCTED UNLAWFUL
SEARCH: all records relating to findings that a peace officer made an unlawful arrest or
conducted and unlawful search.
Due to the voluminous nature of records that the City has to sort through for this request, the
City intends to provide the responsive records on a rolling basis. We are releasing copies of the
files we have compiled and redacted to date. I have attached an electronic copy of the following
responsive records: IA-2020-008B. These records may be accessed in electronic form at the

There are remaining files that are responsive to your request, which we are still in the process of
compiling and redacting. We will forward those files to you as we complete them. We estimate
