RE: Public Records Act Request under PC832.7 Dated February 13, 2023
The City of Barstow (the âCityâ) is currently processing your Public Records Act request received
February 21, 2023 regarding records subject to disclosure under Penal Code section 832.7.
Specifically, you requested:
1. INCIDENTS INVOLVING THE DISCHARGE OF A FIREARM: all incidents involving
discharge of a firearm at a person by a peace officer.
2. USE OF FORCE RESULTING IN DEATH OR GREAT BODILY INJURY: all records
relating to incidents where the use of force by a peace officer or custodial officer against a
person resulted in great bodily injury or death.
3. SUSTAINED FINDINGS OF SEXUAL ASSAULT: all records of incidents where a
sustained finding was made by any agency that a peace officer or custodial officer engaged
in sexual assault involving a member of the public.
4. SUSTAINED FINDINGS OF DISHONESTY: all records relating to incidents where a
sustained finding of dishonesty was made by any agency against a peace officer or
custodial officer.
5. SUSTAINED FINDINGS OF UNREASONABLE OR EXCESSIVE FORCE: all reports
of sustained findings involving a complaint that alleges unreasonable or excessive force.
6. SUSTAINED FINDING THAT AN OFFICER FAILED TO INTERVENE: all reports of
sustained findings that an officer failed to intervene against another officer using force that
is clearly unreasonable or excessive.
7. SUSTAINED FINDING OFFICER ENGAGED IN PREJUDICE OR
DISCRIMINATION: all records relating to incidents where a sustained finding of
prejudice or discrimination against a person on the basis of race, religious creed, color,
national origin, ancestry, physical disability, mental disability, medical condition, genetic
information, marital status, sex, gender identity, gender expression, age, sexual
orientation, or military and veteran status.

8. SUSTAINED FINDINGS OF UNLAWFUL ARREST OR CONDUCTED UNLAWFUL
SEARCH: all records relating to findings that a peace officer made an unlawful arrest or
conducted and unlawful search.
Due to the voluminous nature of records that the City has to sort through for this request, the
City intends to provide the responsive records on a rolling basis. We are releasing copies of the
files we have compiled and redacted to date. I have attached an electronic copy of the following
responsive records: IA-2020-008B. These records may be accessed in electronic form at the
following link:
https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fo/ja2ro56236ooseex75xqt/h?dl=0&rlkey=axj0j6d6alrmzt2h5tswla

There are remaining files that are responsive to your request, which we are still in the process of
compiling and redacting. We will forward those files to you as we complete them. We estimate
the files will be ready for production by July 1, 2023. We will forward those files to you as we
complete them.

    communication="""Dear MuckRock,



    This email regards your public records request dated February 1, 2022.



    You requested the following documents:



    1. I request a complete electronic copy of all Public Records Requests received by your agency in the year 2022 and a complete electronic copy of your agency's Responses to each of these Public Records Requests for the year 2022.
    Note: Parents and students seeking GRADES and/or TRANSCRIPTS in the year 2022 can be excluded from this request.



    Revised request 03/30/23: Excluded multiple MuckRock requests.



    **The third, fourth, and fifth installments on your public records request are available.

    The reason I broke them up into individual installments is due to the number of records. I thought it would be easier to view in smaller chunks of files.

    The remaining public records request that will be provided are all parent/student records and will need to be reviewed and redacted. I am not able to provide all documents by the originally estimated date of June 8, 2023.



    The new completion estimate is now September 20, 2023. I will do my best to complete this request as quickly as possible. I anticipate at least 2-3 installments remain.

    The next installment will be provided by June 28, 2023.

    The district uses SharePoint to deliver response documents.
    Your documents are stored in a SharePoint folder.  I have just shared that folder with you.

    You will receive an email directly from SharePoint to the folder with your files.
    You will then go through a short process to get an access code from SharePoint. That code will come in a second email from SharePoint to you.  If you do not receive the email right away, please check your spam folder.

    **Please review your documents within thirty (30) days. Per RCW 42.56.120(4), if an installment of a records request is not claimed or reviewed, the agency is not obligated to fulfill the balance of the request.

    Please let me know if you have trouble or if you have additional questions.

    At any time that you no longer need the requested information in your public records request, please let me know. I will provide an update or the next installment on or before June 28, 2023.

    If you have questions or concerns, please feel free to contact me.

    communication="""Dear Ms. Barghouty & Ms. Pickoff-White:

    As you know, this office serves as City Attorneys for the City of Clovis (“City”).  We are in receipt of your Public Records Act (“PRA”) request dated January 23, 2023.  Your request states that it seeks records pursuant to Senate Bills 1421 and 16 for police officer records under the categories identified by Penal Code section 832.7, subdivision (b), for the time period of January 1, 2014, to January 23, 2023.

    On March 17, 2023, the City provided you with “Batch 1” containing responsive, non-exempt documents.  On March 22, 2023, the City provided you with “Batch 2” containing additional responsive, non-exempt documents.  We informed you in our prior correspondence dated April 14, 2023, that the City would make all reasonable efforts to provide further responsive, non-exempt documents to you on a rolling basis in a manner consistent with the PRA by no later than May 19, 2023, provided that we would timely notify you if this was not possible.

    Accordingly, enclosed with the transmission of this correspondence, the City is providing you with further responsive, non-exempt, documents.  This additional set of documents will be referred to as “Batch 3.”  Please note that the City will not disclose information such as personal data, including home addresses or telephone numbers, to preserve the anonymity of family members, whistleblowers, complainants, victims, and witnesses.  (Pen. Code § 832.7, subd. (b)(6).)  Additionally, the City will not release any records which contain sensitive and private information that would constitute an unwarranted invasion of privacy and, therefore, the public interest served by not disclosing the records clearly outweighs the public interest served by disclosure.  (Pen. Code, § 832.7, subd. (b)(7); Gov. Code. § 7922.000.)  Accordingly, such information has been redacted from the documents produced.  Deputy City Attorney Matthew M. Lear is the party responsible for asserting the exemptions.

    Due to the volume of the remaining documents, the City is still in the process of preparing the raw audio/video footage for production.  The City will continue to produce these records on a rolling basis and will make all reasonable efforts to provide the requested records to you in a manner consistent with the PRA.  The City anticipates that it will be able to provide some, if not all, of these remaining documents by no later than June 16, 2023, provided that we will timely notify you if this is not possible.

    We thank you for your continued courtesy.  Please contact me if you have any questions.

    Sincerely,
