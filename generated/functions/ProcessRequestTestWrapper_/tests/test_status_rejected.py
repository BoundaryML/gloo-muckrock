    Re: FOIA request

    Mr. Gordon:

    1am the attorney for Pope County, Arkansas. Iam in receipt of a Freedom of Information Act

    request that you sent dated April 20, 2023.

    Please be advised that pursuant ACA. 25-19-105, the Pope County Sheriffs Office is not

    required to respond to requests for information from an out-of-state requestor such as

    yourself. Therefore, you will not be receiving response to your Freedom of Information Act

    request.

    You have sent this same request on numerous occasions, and | have previously provided the

    same response to your FOIA requests. So long as you remain an out-of-state requestor, my

    reply to you that you will not be receiving a response to your FOIA request from the Pope

    County Sheriffs Office will continue to be the same whether you send another request

    tomorrow, next month, or next year. Simply sending an identical request each month, which

    has already been declined, will not yield different results. | highly recommend that you

    consult the Arkansas Freedom of Information Act handbook on the Arkansas Attorney

    General website if you have any questions.

    Sincerely;

    Caroline Haskins
    Business Insider
    Re: FOIL Request Dated April 19, 2023
    To Caroline Haskins:
    The New York County District Attorney's Office has received your Freedom
    of Information Law ("FOIL") request seeking records of e-mailed threats to this
    Office or its employees from March 17, 2003 to the present with regard to the
    ongoing criminal case against Donald Trump, and communications with other law
    enforcement agencies regarding coordinating security for this Office in light of such
    threats. Although you reference the fact that this Office has publicly acknowledged
    that it has received numerous threats since March 17, 2023, we have not released
    copies of the actual threats themselves. Your FOIL request is therefore denied for
    the following reasons:
    First, your request is denied on the ground that disclosure of the records you
    seek would pose a risk to the safety of the staff at this office as well as members of
    the general public who visit this office. Public Officers Law ("POL")Â§ 87(2)(Â£)
    exempts from disclosure records that, "if disclosed, could endanger the life or safety
    of any person." POL Â§ 87 (2)(Â£); In re Digital Forensics Unit v. New York City Police
    Department, 2023 N.Y. App. Div. LEXIS 1506 *2; 2023 N.Y. Slip Op. 01476 (1st
    Dept. 2023); Matter of Bellamy v. New York Czry Police Department, 87 A.D.3d 874,875
    (1st Dept. 2011); Matter of Prisoners' Legal Servs. OJNY v. New York State Dept. of Corr.
    & Community Supervision, 209 A.D.3d 1208, 1211-12 (3d Dept. 2022). Public disclosure
    of the communications between this Office and other law enforcement agencies
    regarding the response to threats made to this Office and its employees-as well as
    copies of the threats themselves-would provide any persons who represent a danger
    to this Office with a blueprint as to how to avoid whatever security systems are put in
    place for the protection of this Office, its staff and members of the public. Disclosure
    of these records could also identify confidential sources of information regarding
    threats to this office, which puts those individuals at risk of retaliation and/ or could

    discourage other such informants from coming forward in the future. 1 Matter of
    Johnson v. New York Ciry Police Dept., 257 A.D.2d 343, 349 (1st Dept. 1999).
    In addition, your request is denied on the ground that the release of the
    requested records may interfere with law enforcement investigation into the threats
    conveyed in those records. POLÂ§ 87(2)(e)(i) exempts from disclosure records
    compiled for law enforcement purposes and which, if disclosed, would interfere with
    an active criminal investigation, as well as with any further investigation and judicial
    proceedings that might be necessary. POLÂ§ 87(2)(e)(i). See Whitley v. New York Counry
    Dist. Atry. 's Office, 101 A.D.3d 455, 455 (1st Dept. 2012); Moreno v. New York Counry
    District Attorney's Office, 38 A.D.3d 358, 358 (1st Dept. 2007); Matter of Legal Aid Sociery
    v NYPD, 274 A.D.2d 207,214 (1st Dept. 2000); Matter of Philip v. NYPD, 2014 N.Y.
    Slip Op 30408(U)(Sup. Ct. N.Y. County 2014).
    Lastly, your request is denied because POLÂ§ 87(2)(e)(iv) exempts from
    disclosure records that would "reveal criminal investigative techniques or procedures,
    except routine techniques and procedures." POLÂ§ 87(2)(e)(iv). Such information is
    protected when "disclosure of those procedures would give rise to a substantial
    likelihood that violators could evade detection by deliberately tailoring their conduct
    in anticipation of avenues of inquiry to be pursued by agency personnel." Fink v.
    Lefkowit~ 47 N.Y.2d 567, 572 (1979); see also Matter of Bellamy v. New York Ciry Police
    Dept., 59 A.D.3d 353 (Sup. Ct., N.Y. County 2009).

    Attorney Robin McCabe, Chief of the Civil Litigation Unit, Office of the General
    Counsel, at the above address.

    1 Moreover, records containing identifying information of possible informants are also protected
    from disclosure under the privacy exemption. POLÂ§ 87(2)(b); Matter of Bellamy, 87 A.D.3d at 875.
