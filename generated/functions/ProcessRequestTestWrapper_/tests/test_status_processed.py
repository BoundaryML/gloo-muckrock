Thank you for contacting DEQ for public information. DEQ has received your request for the following records:

\"To Whom It May Concern:

Pursuant to the Montana Freedom of Information Act, I hereby request the following records:

We are aware that air quality management agencies sometimes conduct \"exceptional event demonstrations,\" which are analyses to demonstrate that emissions from potential exceptional events caused an exceedance of one or more NAAQS. These demonstrations are then submitted to the Regional EPA office in order to request that the office exclude the air quality monitoring data from use in certain regulatory determinations.

Concerning services related to these exceptional event analyses, we request:
1. Any and all executed contracts, memorandums of understanding (MOUs), or other equivalent agreements that are currently active, or have been active within the last five years;
2. Any addenda, amendments, attachments, exhibits, materials, and schedules;
3. Any and all correspondence, between the relevant air quality agency and the contracting individual, corporation, or other entity, related to the implementation of these agreements.

The requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.

In the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.

Thank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 10 business days.

Sincerely,

Dillon Bergin\"

DEQ is presently evaluating your request in order to provide a cost estimation, if requested, or to fulfill the request. We are experiencing a staffing shortage on our records team at the moment but please know that fulfilling your request in a timely manner is a top priority for DEQ.

RE: Your California Public Records Act request dated March 15, 2023
Dear Todd Feathers:
On March 15, 2023, EDD received the following request for Public Records from you:
For each algorithmic tool your agency has used since Jan. 1, 2018, I request the
following records:
1) Executive summaries, project overviews, or comparable records that describe the
scope and purpose of the algorithmic tool.
2) Contracts, statements of work, successful RFP submissions and bid packets, or
comparable records that describe the purchase and/or construction of the algorithmic
tool.
3) User handbooks, guides, training manuals, agency policies, or comparable records
that describe the toolâs functions and its appropriate uses.
Pursuant to California Government Code section 7922.535, EDD has determined that up to
an additional fourteen (14) days will be required to properly determine if disclosable public
records are in the possession of EDD. This additional time is needed to search for, collect,
and appropriately examine a voluminous amount of separate and distinct records.
If you have any questions, please contact me at nicholas.scheuer@edd.ca.gov.
