Administration (FRA) for All communications, between the Federal Railroad Administration and the
Burlington Northern Railroad, Santa Fe Railroad, Great Northern Railroad or Burlington Northern

After conducting a thorough search, we have determined that the agencyâs files do not contain
any records responsive to your request. I am responsible for the determination that the agencyâs
files do not contain any records concerning the above-mentioned request. In making this
determination, we have searched the FRA Office of Railroad Safety. No records matching the

that it is an appeal under FOIA, it must include all arguments and information upon which you

Request No.: 1592775-000
Subject: MIRANDA, DAVID MICHAEL DOS
SANTOS
Dear Mr. Lee:
This is in response to your Freedom of Information/Privacy Acts (FOIPA) request. Based on the
information you provided, we conducted a main entity record search of the Central Records System (CRS)
per our standard search policy. However, we were unable to identify records subject to the FOIPA that are
responsive to your request. Therefore, your request is being closed. If you have additional information
pertaining to the subject of your request, please submit a new request providing the details, and we will
conduct an additional search. For more information about records searches and the standard search policy,
see the enclosed FBI FOIPA Addendum General Information Section.
Please see the paragraphs below for relevant information that may be specific to your request.
Only checked boxes contain corresponding paragraphs relevant to your request. If no boxes are checked,
the corresponding information does not apply.
Please be advised that your request was reopened based on the additional information you
provided. A new search was conducted, and we were unable to identify records subject to the
FOIPA that are responsive to your request.
Records potentially responsive to your request were destroyed. Since this material could not be
reviewed, it is not known if it was responsive to your request. Record retention and disposal is
carried out under supervision of the National Archives and Records Administration (NARA)
according to Title 44 United States Code Section 3301, Title 36 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR)
Chapter 12 Sub-chapter B Part 1228, and 36 CFR 1229.10. Please be advised that the General
Records Schedule (GRS) disposition authority for FOIPA records is DAA-GRS-2016-0002-0001
(GRS 4.2, Item 020).
Records potentially responsive to your request were transferred to the National Archives and
Records Administration (NARA). If you wish to review these records, file a FOIPA request with
NARA at the following address:
National Archives and Records Administration
Special Access and FOIA
8601 Adelphi Road, Room 5500
College Park, MD 20740-6001
Potentially responsive records were identified during the search. However, we were advised that
they were not in their expected locations. An additional search for the missing records also met
with unsuccessful results. Since we were unable to review the records, we were unable to
determine if they were responsive to your request.
The identification records requested are maintained by the FBIâs Criminal Justice Information
Services (CJIS) Division; therefore, we have forwarded a portion of your request to CJIS for
processing. To check the status of this request, please contact CJIS directly at (304) 625-5590.
For additional information, see the enclosed FBI FOIPA Addendum General Information Section.
Requests for expedited processing are not applicable when a final response is issued within ten
calendar days.

Police departments should be aware that the search conducted was limited to FBI records.
Requests for criminal history records or rap sheets should be directed to Criminal Justice
Information Services (CJIS). Information regarding CJIS is listed in the enclosed FBI FOIPA
Addendum General Information Section.
Records potentially responsive to your request were transferred to the National Personnel Records
Center - Civilian Personnel Records (NPRC-CPR). In order to obtain information on a file located
at the NPRC, your request must be mailed to the following address:
National Archives and Records Administration
ATTN: Archival Programs
P.O. Box 38757
St. Louis, MO 63138
You also requested information regarding one or more third parties. Please be advised the FBI
will neither confirm nor deny the existence of such records pursuant to FOIA exemptions (b)(6) and
(b)(7)(C), 5 U.S.C. Â§Â§ 552 (b)(6) and (b)(7)(C). The mere acknowledgement of the existence of
FBI records on third party individuals could reasonably be expected to constitute an unwarranted
invasion of personal privacy. This is our standard response to such requests and should not be
taken to mean that records do, or do not, exist.
Please refer to the enclosed FBI FOIPA Addendum for additional standard responses applicable to
your request. âPart 1â of the Addendum includes standard responses that apply to all requests. âPart 2â
includes additional standard responses that apply to all requests for records about yourself or any third party
individuals. âPart 3â includes general information about FBI records that you may find useful. Also
enclosed is our Explanation of Exemptions.
Additional information about the FOIPA can be found at www.fbi.gov/foia. Should you have
questions regarding your request, please feel free to contact foipaquestions@fbi.gov. Please reference the
FOIPA Request number listed above in all correspondence concerning your request.
If you are not satisfied with the Federal Bureau of Investigationâs determination in response to this
request, you may administratively appeal by writing to the Director, Office of Information Policy (OIP), United
States Department of Justice, 441 G Street, NW, 6th Floor, Washington, D.C. 20530, or you may submit an

Appeal.\" Please cite the FOIPA Request Number assigned to your request so it may be easily identified.
You may seek dispute resolution services by emailing the FBIâs FOIA Public Liaison at
foipaquestions@fbi.gov. The subject heading should clearly state âDispute Resolution Services.â Please
also cite the FOIPA Request Number assigned to your request so it may be easily identified. You may also

FBI FOIPA Addendum
As referenced in our letter responding to your Freedom of Information/Privacy Acts (FOIPA) request, the FBI FOIPA Addendum
provides information applicable to your request. Part 1 of the Addendum includes standard responses that apply to all requests.
Part 2 includes standard responses that apply to requests for records about individuals to the extent your request seeks the listed
information. Part 3 includes general information about FBI records, searches, and programs.
Part 1: The standard responses below apply to all requests:
(i) 5 U.S.C. Â§ 552(c). Congress excluded three categories of law enforcement and national security records from the
requirements of the FOIPA [5 U.S.C. Â§ 552(c)]. FBI responses are limited to those records subject to the requirements of the
FOIPA. Additional information about the FBI and the FOIPA can be found on the www.fbi.gov/foia website.
(ii) Intelligence Records. To the extent your request seeks records of intelligence sources, methods, or activities, the FBI can
neither confirm nor deny the existence of records pursuant to FOIA exemptions (b)(1), (b)(3), and as applicable to requests for
records about individuals, PA exemption (j)(2) [5 U.S.C. Â§Â§ 552/552a (b)(1), (b)(3), and (j)(2)]. The mere acknowledgment of
the existence or nonexistence of such records is itself a classified fact protected by FOIA exemption (b)(1) and/or would reveal
intelligence sources, methods, or activities protected by exemption (b)(3) [50 USC Â§ 3024(i)(1)]. This is a standard response
and should not be read to indicate that any such records do or do not exist.
Part 2: The standard responses below apply to all requests for records on individuals:
(i) Requests for Records about any IndividualâWatch Lists. The FBI can neither confirm nor deny the existence of any
individualâs name on a watch list pursuant to FOIA exemption (b)(7)(E) and PA exemption (j)(2) [5 U.S.C. Â§Â§ 552/552a
(b)(7)(E), (j)(2)]. This is a standard response and should not be read to indicate that watch list records do or do not exist.
(ii) Requests for Records about any IndividualâWitness Security Program Records. The FBI can neither confirm nor deny
the existence of records which could identify any participant in the Witness Security Program pursuant to FOIA exemption
(b)(3) and PA exemption (j)(2) [5 U.S.C. Â§Â§ 552/552a (b)(3), 18 U.S.C. 3521, and (j)(2)]. This is a standard response and
should not be read to indicate that such records do or do not exist.
(iii) Requests for Confidential Informant Records. The FBI can neither confirm nor deny the existence of confidential
informant records pursuant to FOIA exemptions (b)(7)(D), (b)(7)(E), and (b)(7)(F) [5 U.S.C.Â§ Â§ 552 (b)(7)(D), (b)(7)(E), and
(b)(7)(F)] and Privacy Act exemption (j)(2) [5 U.S.C.Â§ 552a (j)(2)]. The mere acknowledgment of the existence or nonexistence of
such records would reveal confidential informant identities and information, expose law enforcement techniques, and endanger
the life or physical safety of individuals. This is a standard response and should not be read to indicate that such records do or do
not exist.
Part 3: General Information:
(i) Record Searches and Standard Search Policy. The Record/Information Dissemination Section (RIDS) searches for
reasonably described records by searching systems, such as the Central Records System (CRS), or locations where responsive
records would reasonably be found. The CRS is an extensive system of records consisting of applicant, investigative,
intelligence, personnel, administrative, and general files compiled by the FBI per its law enforcement, intelligence, and
administrative functions. The CRS spans the entire FBI organization, comprising records of FBI Headquarters, FBI Field Offices,
and FBI Legal AttachÃ© Offices (Legats) worldwide; Electronic Surveillance (ELSUR) records are included in the CRS. The
standard search policy is a search for main entity records in the CRS. Unless specifically requested, a standard search does not
include a search for reference entity records, administrative records of previous FOIPA requests, or civil litigation files.
a. Main Entity Records â created for individuals or non-individuals who are the subjects or the focus of
an investigation
b. Reference Entity Records- created for individuals or non-individuals who are associated with a case
but are not known subjects or the focus of an investigation
(ii) FBI Records. Founded in 1908, the FBI carries out a dual law enforcement and national security mission. As part of this dual
mission, the FBI creates and maintains records on various subjects; however, the FBI does not maintain records on every
person, subject, or entity.
(iii) Foreseeable Harm Standard. As amended in 2016, the Freedom of Information Act provides that a federal agency may
withhold responsive records only if: (1) the agency reasonably foresees that disclosure would harm an interest protected by one
of the nine exemptions that FOIA enumerates, or (2) disclosure is prohibited by law (5 United States Code, Section
552(a)(8)(A)(i)). The FBI considers this foreseeable harm standard in the processing of its requests.
(iv) Requests for Criminal History Records or Rap Sheets. The Criminal Justice Information Services (CJIS) Division
provides Identity History Summary Checks â often referred to as a criminal history record or rap sheet. These criminal history
records are not the same as material in an investigative âFBI file.â An Identity History Summary Check is a listing of
information taken from fingerprint cards and documents submitted to the FBI in connection with arrests, federal employment,
naturalization, or military service. For a fee, individuals can request a copy of their Identity History Summary Check. Forms
and directions can be accessed at www.fbi.gov/about-us/cjis/identity-history-summary-checks. Additionally, requests can be
submitted electronically at www.edo.cjis.gov. For additional information, please contact CJIS directly at (304) 625-5590.

Dear Mob:

You appealed from the action of the Federal Bureau of Investigation on your Freedom of
Information Act request for access to records concerning a named third party. 1 note that your
âappeal concerns the adequacy of the FBI\'s search for responsive records.

After carefully considering your appeal, I am affirming the FBI\'s action on your
request. The FBI informed you that it could locate no responsive records subject to the FOIA in
its files. 1 have determined that the FBI action was correct and that it conducted an adequate,
reasonable search for such records.

I note that on appeal you seek various additional records that you did not originally
request. You may not on appeal expand the scope of your initial request, which was limited to
records main files only. Accordingly, o the extent that you now seek records concerning cross
references, you may wish to submit a new FOIA request to the FBI.

Please be advised that this Office\'s decision was made only after a full review of this
matter. Your appeal was assigned to an attomey with this Office who thoroughly reviewed and
analyzed your appeal, your underlying request, and the action of the FBI in response to your
request

lawsuit in federal district court in accordance with 5 U.S.C. Â§ SS2(a)4)(B).

For your information, the Office of Goverment Information Services (OGIS) offers.
