The superior court is not in possession of any of the requested items.
The only documents we have, that are remotely associated, are with case # 23F055 which I have attached.
The Trinity Superior Court is not a county department, It may interest you to learn that the California Public Records Act (Gov. Code, § 6250 et seq.) does not apply to the court. (See id., § 6252(f)(1); Cal. Const., art. VI, § 4.) Instead, the public is entitled to have access to judicial administrative records under rule 10.500 of the California Rules of Court.

Due to the size and number of custodians of your requests, as the coordinator I have been unable to determine the exact associated fees. Yet, I am submitting the below as estimated cost subject to be modified once all documentation has been compiled and submitted.

In accordance with Policy<chrome-extension://efaidnbmnnnibpcajpcglclefindmkaj/https:/andersoncountytn.gov/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Anderson-County-Public-Records-Policy.pdf> stated below and subject to your prior waiver of inspection of records, the cost associated with the electronic copies reimbursement of a thumb drive is $2.70 per drive. Additionally, the current associated cost for retrieving, redacting, etc. is $122, which is subject to increase based upon the remaining custodian’s submission of time spent compiling. If you request the thumb drive(s) be mailed to your Kingston Springs, TN address rather than retrieving in person, you are also required to cover the cost of shipping. Once the exact amount can be determined, I will notify a detailed cost amount. If electing to receive the data via United States Postal Service, we will mail the thumb drive(s) once the check payment has been received.

Feel free to contact me if you have further questions or concerns before then.

    communication="""Dear Matthew,

Per your request of May 22, 2023, I have updated your FOIA request, FOIA
tracking number *RD 77093*, to reflect that you narrowed your request to
FBI case file *100-MI-15812 *(I have also removed FBI case
file 100A-BA-25222 from your request). Since your request does not exceed
700 pages, I have reassigned it to our *first-tier processing queue*.
Taking into consideration our existing backlog, we *estimate* it will take*
39 months* to complete processing.

Records transferred to the custody of the National Archives are exempt from
the fee and fee waiver provisions of the Freedom of Information Act because
a fee schedule was in effect prior to enactment. The applicable section
states that “nothing in this subparagraph shall supersede fees chargeable
under a statute specifically providing for setting the level of fees for
particular types of records” (5 U.S.C. 552 (a)(4)(A)(vi)). The relevant fee
statute authorizes the National Archives “to charge a fee for making or
authenticating copies or reproductions of materials transferred to the
Archivist’s custody.” (44 U.S.C. 2116(c)). The inability to grant the
requested fee waiver does not constitute a denial under the terms of the
Freedom of Information Act.


In the future, someone from our office will contact you to inform you that
a line-by-line review of the case file has been completed. At that point,
you will have the option to order a copy for a fee of 80 cents per page or
view the record in-person.


If you visit the National Archives at College Park, Maryland, we will save
a digital surrogate of the original record (this will be the reviewed copy
that may include redactions) to a CD and you will be able to view the file*
at no cost*. If you need to use one of our public access computers you will
need to bring a universal serial bus (USB) drive so that you will be able
to download a copy. You also have the option of bringing your own personal
laptop that has a CD-Drive in order to copy the file(s) that way.


Sincerely,
