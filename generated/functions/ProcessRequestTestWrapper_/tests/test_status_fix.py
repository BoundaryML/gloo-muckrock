    communication="""Dear Ms. Collins,
We received your Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request dated 13 May 2021, for any files concerning a business entity apparently known as \"USAF II LLC,\" a hedge fund that controlled it called D.B. Zwirn & Co., and the U.S. Air Force. This would include memos, schedules, e-mails, depositions, reports, and investigative reports related to this entity, including those that would clarify the relationship between the US Air Force and \"USAF II LLC.\"
Due to our organization having a significant number of pending FOIA requests, we have been unable to process your request within the statutory 20 workdays.  To ensure all requesters are properly served in the order their requests were received, we have instituted multitrack processing of requests.  Based on the information you provided, we have placed your request in the complex track and have assigned FOIA Case Number 2021-02798-F to identify your request.
Since it has been some time since your case was submitted, please provide us with the following information as to your desire going forward.   Please let us know if you still desire the records being requested or if you would like to withdraw your request.  We ask that you submit your desire by responding to this email not later than 7 June 2023.  If we do not receive your response by the above referenced date, your case will be “administratively closed, no fees assessed.”  Should your case be “administratively closed” you have the option to resubmit your request at a later date via the Public Access Link.
Should you desire the FOIA Office to continue working your case, please note, currently, there are approximately 800 cases that will need to be processed ahead of your case to comply with 32 CFR, Part 286.8 subparagraph (a).  We will strive to provide an update between 90 and 120 days.  Our policy is to process requests within their respective tracks in the order in which they were received.  We do process each FOIA request as quickly as possible, however delayed responses can be expected.
Should you need to contact us about your request, please do so via email saf.aa.haf.foia.workflow@us.af.mil Attention Ms. Janet Beasley.    Please ensure to reference your case number.

This regards the FOIA request you sent to the Federal Aviation Administration on May 16, 2023.  I contacted Air Traffic Services and was informed the TFMS Repository dates back to January 1, 1998.  They would not have records dating back to 1983.  If you would like a formal no records found response letter, please reply to this email with that decision.  Or you may submit a new request to me for TFMS records for dates 1998 forward.

Thank you,
