This regards the FOIA request you sent to the Federal Aviation Administration on May 16, 2023.  I contacted Air Traffic Services and was informed the TFMS Repository dates back to January 1, 1998.  They would not have records dating back to 1983.  If you would like a formal no records found response letter, please reply to this email with that decision.  Or you may submit a new request to me for TFMS records for dates 1998 forward.

    Dear Gabriel Garcia:
    We are in receipt of your Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request dated 5 May
    2023, in which you seck
    All signals intelligence (SIGINT) reports and documents pertaining to major
    international events and crises from 1950 to 2000. This includes, but is not limited
    to, the Cuban Missile Crisis, the Vietnam War, and the Iranian Revolution. Please
    provide any available information on the intercepted communications, analysis, and
    impact of this intelligence on U.S. policy and decision-making.
    Your request was received on 17 May 2023, and assigned Case Number 116392. This letter
    provides information relating to the processing of your request that we are required to
    inform you about pursuant to the FOIA, and applicable Department of Defense (DoD) and
    NSA regulations.

    For purposes of this request and based on the information you provided in your
    letter, you are considered an âall otherâ requester. You must pay for search time in excess
    Of 2 hours and duplication in excess of 100 pages.

    âThe topic of your request is overly broad, unreasonably burdensome, and not
    specific enough to allow a reasonable search. Department of Defense (DoD) Manual
    5400.07 states that the requester must provide a description of the desired record so that the
    Government i able to locate the record with a reasonable amount of effort. Responding to
    this request would require a search of every email, every database, and every document
    created (whether electronic or paper) over a 50 year period. Furthermore, Agency email is
    decentralized and tasking an email search would have to be conducted singularly and
    manually. Tasking al or even large groups of Agency employees for individual email
    searches constitutes an overly burdensome search. This search effort would significantly
    impede NSA activities and is unreasonably burdensome. You have not stated your request
    in such a manner that we could reasonably determine the appropriate files to search. As
    such, your request does not meet the requirements of the FOIA and is not a valid request
    

    FOIA Case: 116392

    In accordance with the DoD regulation, processing of your request is being held in
    abeyance pending a response from you, within 30 days of the date of this letter, narrowing
    Your request so that a reasonable search can be done. If we do not hear from you within that
    time, we will assume that you are no longer interested in pursuing this request, and we will
    administratively close your case as an invalid FOIA request with no further processing.

    Correspondence related 10 your request should include the case number assigned to
    âyour request, which is included in the fist paragraph of this letter. Your letter should be
    addressed to the National Security Agency, FOIA Division (P132), 9800 Savage Road STE
    6932, Ft. George G. Meade, MD 20755-6932, or may be sent by facsimile to 443-479-
    3612. If sent by fax, it should be marked for the attention of the FOIA Division. The
    telephone number of the FOIA Division is 301-688-6527.

    pages that you may wish to review to aid you in further defining your request. It can be
