                April 24, 2023 Dear Supervisors Mandelman, Melgar, Peskin and Preston,
                At the recent hearing of the Land Use & Transportation Committee, much commentary focused 
                on an anonymous petition purporting to represent over 100 members of the Castro Merchants 
                Association and other businesses in our neighborhood. It was represented that this hastily 
                assembled petition showed neighboring merchants were in favor of APE\'s plans for the 
                renovation and remodeling of the Castro Theatre. We do not question that some of our 
                members want the Castro Theatre to fully reopen and support APE\'s plans unconditionally, but I
                am writing on behalf of the Castro Merchants to question the veracity of this petition and ask 
                that you please disregard it until we have ample opportunity to investigate it further.
                As you can see from the email below, Wells Fargo has not signed onto the petition as claimed in 
                the attached testimony. We question whether other national corporations listed, such as Whole 
                Foods, Pet Food Supply (sic) and FedEx are signers as well.
                A number of signers are duplicates, with multiple signatures from one business.
                Many signatures are from front counter staff, not business owners.
                Signatories, some with limited English, have reported that they did not know what they were 
                signing.
                The whole petition is presented anonymously with no logo or letterhead, and we have heard 
                reports that petition circulators represented to shopkeepers that the petition was sponsored by 
                Castro Merchants as indicated in testimony. This is false.
                The premise of the petition is disingenuous at best. In fact, it is very likely that all the board 
                members of the Castro Merchants and very likely all the members of the Save the Castro 
                Coalition would sign the petition as well as written - but it says nothing about the removal of 
                the permanent seating and leveling of the floor, or about the 180 dark days proposed by APE, 
                the ADA concerns, the LGBTQ cultural displacement issues, etc. The petition is misleading on its 
                face.
                The petition did not come from the merchants. It was coordinated by APE with the Castro CBD, 
                which represents the building owners, not the small businesses of the neighborhood.
                The petition was circulated by the Castro CBD to our members without our knowledge. APE has 
                divided the community with this kind of clumsy tactic for months, and it saddens us to hear it 
                represented as worthy of consideration by the Supervisors. 
                We ask that you disregard this fraudulent petition. We will keep you informed as we continue 
                our investigation into its veracity.
                In the meantime, Castro Merchants stands by its statement, endorsed by our membership. We 
                will support APE\'s plans for the Castro Theatre once Supervisor Mandelman confirms that APE 
                (1) has provided an adequate independent economic report showing the positive effects of the 
                business plans for the neighboring merchants, and (2) continues to participate in good faith 
                negotiations with the community.
                Thank you for your attention to this matter,

                Terry Beswick, Treasurer
                Castro Merchants""",

                7. The total number and brief description of 911 calls from schools in your district to local 
                police departments conducted during the 2018-2019, 2019-2020, 2020-2021, and 2021-
                2022 school years.
                8. A description of the proposed budget for mental, social, or emotional health support 
                personnel for the school district. 
                The District responds to each request as follows: 
                1. Information responsive to your request can be found at: 
                https://profiles.doe.mass.edu/ssdr/default.aspx?orgcode=01530000&orgtypecode=5&=01
                530000&. 
                There are no additional responsive documents in the Districtâs possession, custody, 
                and/or control. Appropriate law enforcement agencies may be able to provide additional 
                information. 
                2. The documents you requested contain information that is exempt from public disclosure 
                pursuant to federal and state student and family privacy laws.1 Under state law, the 
                requested documents are student records under Massachusetts student record laws and 
                regulations and is therefore exempt from the definition of âpublic recordsâ pursuant to 
                M.G.L c. 4, Â§7, Twenty-sixth exemptions (a) and (c). The District asserts that âexemption 
                (c)â under G.L. c. 4 Â§7(26)(c) applies to your current request because the District is required 
                to withhold any materials relating to specifically named individuals for which the 
                disclosure may constitute an unwarranted invasion of personal privacy. G.L. c. 4 Â§7(26)(c). 
                It is important to note that this duty is not specific to student records, but rather, applies to 
                any student record information or material that exposes private information.
                1 20 U.S.C. Â§1232g, as amended, 34 C.F.R. Part 99, M.G.L. c. 71 Â§34E, and 603 C.M.R. 23.00, et seq.

                800 Hingham Street, Suite 204S, Rockland, MA 02370
                Tel: 339.788.9577 Fax: 339.788.9915
                Under federal law, the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (âFERPAâ) prohibits the 
                disclosure of personally identifiable information (PII) regarding students to third parties. 20 U.S.C.
                Â§1232g (a)(4)(A); 34 C.F.R. 99.3. Pursuant to 34 C.F.R. 99.3, personally identifiable information 
                includes, but is not limited to:
                ï· âThe student\'s name;
                ï· The name of the student\'s parent or other family members;
                ï· The address of the student or student\'s family;
                ï· A personal identifier, such as the student\'s social security number, student number, or 
                biometric record;
                ï· Other indirect identifiers, such as the student\'s date of birth, place of birth, and mother\'s 
                maiden name;
                ï· Other information that, alone or in combination, is linked or linkable to a specific student 
                that would allow a reasonable person in the school community, who does not have personal 
                knowledge of the relevant circumstances, to identify the student with reasonable certainty; 
                or
                ï· Information requested by a person who the educational agency or institution reasonably 
                believes knows the identity of the student to whom the education record relates.â 
                It is the Districtâs position that incident reports are student records and contain PII related to 
                individual students. Therefore, the District declines to produce incident reports. 
                3. Documentation responsive to your request is attached hereto as Exhibit 1. 
                4. See Exhibit 1. 
                5. See Exhibt 1. 
                6. See Exhibit 1. 
                7. There are no responsive documents in the Districtâs possession, custody, and or control. 
                Appropriate law enforcement agencies may be able to provide additional information. 
                8. See Exhibit 1. 
                Please note that you have the right to appeal the denial of your request to the supervisor of 
                records and have the right to seek judicial review of the supervisorâs decision in superior court 
                under G.L. c. 66 Â§10A. 
                Please contact me if you have any questions or concerns.
                Very truly yours,
                /s/ Jocelyn Brisebois

                Dear Reverend Baird:
                N This will acknowledge receipt of your letter of
                Je July 16, 1964, in vhich you enclosed a printed card
                captioned \"Open Letter to Communists and Their Sympathizers\".

                âThis matter was presented to the United States
                Attorney, Chicago, Illinois, and after careful examination
                of the wording on the card, he advised that the threat in
                the card is conditional and does not lend itself to
                prosecution under the Federal Extortion Statute.

                Should you receive additional letters of a similar
                nature, please communicate with this office. I would suggest
                that such coummications be handled as little as possible

                At 2:35 p.m., 7/13/64, Mrs. KENNETH MONTGOMERY,

                875 Bridlewood, Northbrook, Illinois, telephone CR 2-2288,
                : telephonically contacted the writer and advised as follows:

                Mrs. MONTGOMERY recently received, s threatening
                letter through the mails from Denyilie: lA Se has
                been in touch with an agent of the FBI named HARVEY (JOHNSON)
                concerning this matter and was told by this agent in the
                event she received any additional letters of a threatening
                nature, she should contact the FBI.

                Mrs. MONTGOMERY stated that she received a letter
                through the mails on this date which was postmarked Kingsberg,
                California, 7/8/64, which she described as \"an open letter
                to Communists\". She stated that, in effect, this letter
                says that the Communists don\'t like GOLDWATER and have
                made threats against him, The letter further states that .
                if anything should happen to GOLDWATER there will be a lot
                of Communists in the morgue. In addition, if any American
                soldiers are killed in Asia, there will be reprisals taken
                on the lives of Communists.

                Mrs. MONTGOMERY was told that the agent who had
                previously contacted her would be notified of the foregoing.

                Result of examination:

                The message comprising Q13 is a mechanical reproduction
                and not original typewriting. The make and model of typewriter
                used to type the original was not determined. The typewriting
                on the envelope designated as Ql4 is too limited for classification
                although it is most like Underwood elite style type.

                Item Q13 was searched through the Anonymous Letter File,
                but nothing of significance was found. A photograph has been
                added to this file for future reference.

                An examination of the paper comprising Q13 and Q14
                disclosed no watermarks, indented writing or other characteristics
                which would aid in tracing the origin of the paper or the
                identity of the writer,

                The evidence is being retained temporarily.

                will be advised as to the results of same. ;
                You should promptly furnish a copy of the anonymous
                communication to the U. S. Attorney advising him of the

                obtain a prosecutive opinion as to whether the contents are in

                presentation to the U. S. Attorney and providing he declines
                prosecution, Chicago should address a letter to the victim
                making reference to the letter he received from the Chief
                Postal Inspector and thereafter furnish the victim with the
                prosecutive opinion. He should be advised that no further
                investigation is to be conducted by this Bureau, If the
                U. S. Attorney feels the communication is in violation of
                the Statutes, Washington Field Office should be promptly
                advised and instructed to immediately interview Torer for |

                All offices note interviews with victims having a
                security background should be handled by two experienced Agents.
                No comment should be made which could possibly enable any of
                the victims to criticize this Bureau. In the event any of
                the victims raise the question as to why investigation of this
                matter was delayed, they should be advised of the U. S. Attorney\'s
                initial opinion and the fact that the Department has reviewed
                this matter and has requested investigation.

                In interviews, attempt should be made to locate and
                obtain the threatening letters and envelopes received by the
                victims and these letters and envelopes promptly furnished
                to the Laboratory for appropriate document and latent finger-
                print examinations.

                the United States known to SCHAPPES to have received

                identical Anonymous Letters. This Page also mentions
                some US Senators and other public figures who have
                heen contacted about these Anonymous Letters.

                For Chicago\'s information, MORRIS U, SCHAPPES
                was one of the Original Security Index subjects in
                the NYO. Note his low NY and Bureau file numbers. He
                formerly was a Key Figure in the NYO bub recently
                was dropped from this designation. As long ago as
                1935, SCHAPPES was the Superior of the CP official who
                was then Educational Director of the Communist Party
                (CP) of New York, He has long been interested in CP
                Educational and Jewish Matters.

                SAM PEVZNER, mentioned above, currently is a
                Security Index subject and Key Figure in the NYO.
                PEVZNER is on the Editorial Board of \"Jewish Currents\".
                He 1s not being interviewed by the NYO. If he sends

                Result of examination:

                It vas found that the addresses on the envelopes
                designated as G13, @15, 17, Qcl9, Q21, G23, 25, Q27, 429,
                031, 433, Q35 and Q37 were all prepared on a typewriter or
                typewriters equipped with Underwood elite type spaced twelve
                Tetters per inch. The typewriting is too limited to permit
                a determination as to whether these addresses were prepared
                on the same typewriter, These envelopes are all similar in
                size and style, and each bears a postage stamp commemorating
                Sam Houston. Â°

                The messages on the cards designated as Q14, Q1G,
                Â«18, Qc20, 422, Q24, Q26, 028, 430, C32, Q34, Q36 and (38
                are mechanical reproductions made from the same original.
                The make and model of typewriter used to type the original
                fron which these reproductions were made were not determined
                because no such standard was located in the Typewriter
                Standards File, The place where these reproductions were
                nade vas not determined.

                To indented writing, watermarks or other charac-
                teristics vere found which would aid in tracing the origin .
                of the paper or the identity of the senders. .

                A further search. of the Anonymous Letter File was
                not made at this time,]

                The evidence is being retained temporarily.

                Salle Street, advised as follows:
                About the middle of July, 1964, she received the
                folloving items in the mail at her residence, 2821 North
                Pine Grove Avenue, Chicago:
                Envelope postmarked \"JUL 8 PM 1964  KINGSBURG
                CALIF.\" with typewritten address \"Pearl Hart 2821 N.
                Pine Grove Chicago, 11.\"
                A white card contained therein with a printed
                message, possibly mimeographed, captioned \"OPEN LETTER
                TO COMMUNISTS & THEIR SYMPATHIZERS\".
                She made the envelope and card available and stated
                she did not desire to have them returned to her.
                She has no suspects in mind who might have sent
                these items to her. She has never been to Kingsburg,
                California, and has no acquaintances there. She has
                never received any other mail so postmarked.
                She noted that she has been practicing law for more
                than 50 years in Chicago and has had numerous articles
                printed that carried her home address as listed on the
                envelope.
                She recalled that when she opened the above
                described envelope, she tore the envelope to the left of and
                below the postage stamp and repaired the tears with
                white tape. She said the fingerprints on the tape and
                adjacent thereto are undoubtedly her fingerprints. She is
                the only person who handled the card. She has never been
                fingerprinted and said she has no objection to being
                fingerprinted for elimination purposes.

                . Rabbi S. BURR YAMPOL, 6159 North Kenmore Avenue,
                advised as follows:
                During the early part of July, 1964, he received
                at his residence an envelope postmarked Kingsburg, California,
                that contained a white card bearing a printed message captioned
                \"An Open Letter to Communists and Their Sympathizers\". The
                message was to the effect that if any communists committed -
                any act of violence against Senator GOLDWATER, the people
                of the United States would ill the morgue with corpses of
                communists.
                Ho has never received similar cards or messages and
                has no suspects who might have directed the card to him. He
                has never been to Kingsburg, California, and has never received
                other mail so postmarked.
                He was advised that if he desired protection in
                this matter, he should inform the Chicago Police Department
                of the wording of the card.
                Then asked if he could make the envelope and
                card available, he stated he gave them to a friend but would
                ask his friend if he could regain possession of the items.
                At this point, Rabbi YAMPOL placed a telephone call and asked
                for \"JACK\" and apparently was informed that JACK was not
                available. Rabbi YAMPOL then stated he would attempt to :
                obtain the items and would advise the FBI if he was successful.
                Rabbi YAMPOL stated he is well known throughout
                1 the United States and that his home address has been carried
                in newspaper stories throughout the United States for many
                years. He was unable to furnish additional information,

                having a building on the west sideof Chicago condemned by
                the city. The building was used as the Chicago Office of
                the American Nazi Party which has headquarters in Virginia
                and is led by a man named ROCKWELL, The prime purpose of
                the committee is to eliminate Nazism in America and the
                American Nazi Party has a goal of climinating Jews in Amer-
                ica.
                In July, 1964, Rabbi YAMPOL reccived an anonymous
                threatening card mailed at Kingsburg, California. At a
                meoting of his committee, he read the card to the assemblage and
                many thought the American Nazi Party would be the only organ-
                ization that would direct such a âthreat to Rabbi YAMPOL.
                âThe committee decided to direct letters to United
                States Senators EVERETT DIRKSEN and PAUL DOUGLAS enclosing
                copies of the threatening card and requesting investigation

                telephonically because he would not be available for a
                personal interview until after the Christmas season.
                He advised as follows:
                Sometime during July, 1964, he received an
                envelope postmarked from some place in California,
                name of city unrecalled. The envelope contained a
                mimeographed card about Communists and Senator GOLDWATER.
                He vas unable to recall additional details about the
                wording on the card.
                About the same t: ve in politics
                in Evanston, Illinois, for House of bs
                tives, who resides & bc
                Illinois, Thinking tl cary gl e relating
                o S activities f Democratic Party and candidates,
                he gave the card to who later informed him he had
                sent the card to Senator PAUL H. DOUGLAS, Washington,
                D. C., requesting some type of action be taken against
                the sender of the card. Since that time, helms not
                heard further about the matter.
                He had no suspects in mind who might have sent
                the letter to him. He knew of only one other person Who
                received a similar card and identified him as JACK KORSHAK,

                other individual who may have sent the threatening post card
                to Rabbi YAUPOL but felt certain it was from a member of the
                American Nazi Party as her organization has conducted a

                Date 11/24/64

                Mrs. KENNETH MONTGOMERY, 875 Bridlewood Road, Northbrook;
                Illinois, advised the following:

                On July 8, 1964, she received at her residence an
                envelope postmarked \"Kingsburg, California\" that contained a
                whitecard bearing a printed message captioned \"Open letter to
                Communists and their sympathizers\". The message was to the
                effect that if any Communists committed any act of violence
                against Senator GOLDWATER, the people of the United States would
                Â£111 the morgue with corpses of Communists.

                She has never received any similar cards or messages
                or has no suspects who might have directed this card to her.

                il She has never been in Kingsburg, California and she has no
                suspects concerning who sent the card and envelppe to her. She
                does not know of any other persons who received similar letters.

                | She is aware that if she needs protection she is to
                notify her local Northbrook, Illinois Police Department of the
                contents of the letter that she received.

                She believes that the individual possibly obtained her
                address because she worked and attended the Mississippi Summer
                Project at Oxford, Ohio.

                The following description of Mrs. MONTGOMERY was obtained:

                âTHEIR SYMPATHIZERS\"
                Result of examination:.

                It was found- that the addresses on the envelopes
                designated as Q41, Q13 and others were prepared on a
                typewriter or typewriters equipped with Underwood elite
                type spaced twelve letters per inch. The typewriting is
                too limited to permit a determination as to whether these
                addresses were prepared on the same typewriter. These
                envelopes are similar in size and style, and each bears
                a postage stamp commemorating Sam Houston.

                The messages on the cards designated as Q42,

                Ql4 and others are mechanical reproductions made from

                the same original. The make and model of typewritÃ©r>

                used to prepare the original from which these reproductions
                were made were not determined because no such standard

                was located in the Typewriter Standards File. The place
                where these reproductions were made was not determined.

                No indented writing, watermarks or other
                peculiarities were found which might aid in tracing the
                origin of the paper or the identity of the senders.

                . The evidence is being retained temporarily.

                by all other victims in this case and it is quoted as follows:

                âOPEN LETTER TO COMMUNISTS & THEIR SYMPATHIZERS

                It has come to our attention that threats have
                been made against Sen. Goldwater\'s life, and that
                your Soviet Communist UN delegate Fedorenko called
                for Goldwater to be \"put into a strait-jacketâ.

                ited. LIf.any violence is.directedragainst Senator
                Goldwater, Communists in the U.S.A. herby stand ad-
                vised that their corpses will then fill the morgues.

                There is also a growing sentiment among patriots -
                to require a Communist life for every American boy
                killed by your colleagues in Asia or elsewhere.

                slaved a billion human beings by means of terror,

                vere interviewed but they were unable to suggest any logical
                suspects. FD 302s on all interviews and attempted interviews
                are being furnished the Chicago Office pursuant to instructions
                in Buairtel dated 10/29/64.

                The original card and envelope mailed to CLARA EVANS
                was obtained from her and has been forwarded to the FBI Labora-
                tory for processing. The Chicago Office will be advised of the
                results.

                sent the letter to him. He, CRILEY and HART discussed the
                cards and none of them were ablt to understand why they
                had received them, Reverend BAIRD said he has never been

                to the Chicago FBI Office an envelope she had received in
                July, 1964, from Kingsburg, California, that contained a

                THEIR SYMPATHIZERS,â She handled the items as did her
                husband and several.friends. She had planned to throw the
                card away but decided to send it to the FBI because it
                J contained a vague threat and she thought it might be of
                interest to the FBI.
                â She said she had no suspects and did not know
                anyone in California. She had never received similar items
                before and has not received any other correspondence in a
                similar vein since, She did not know whether or not any

                OIVA NURMELA was contacted at his place of employment, |
                . 321 Fast 12th Street. He advised that he had received an
                anonymous letter through the United States mail in about
                July or August, 1964, He advised that he could not recall
                the contents of the letter but that it was threatening in |
                nature. He did not place any identifying marks of any kind
                on the letter or the envelope but did send them to his . |
                Congressman, JEFFERY COHELAN. He recalled that the envelope
                was postmarked \"Chicago\". .
                ] . He advised that COHELAN had not returned the letter |
                Â© or the envelope to him, He recalled having received one :
                letter from COHELAN which enclosed a copy of a letter from J.
                EDGAR HOOVER. The letter from Director HOOVER to COHELAN *
                indicated that âthe FBI did not think this was a very good
                case\" 50 he dismissed the matter from his mind. In the last
                few days he received another letter from COHELAN which enclosed
                a copy of a second letter from J, EDGAR HOOVER to COHELAN. |
                This second letter stated that the case would be investigated.
                NURMELA advised that he had handled the letter and . -
                envelope and some woman whose identity he could not recall
                had also handled it. He stated that he had the impression
                that this woman lived somewhere out of town but could not
                recall who she was. She told him she had receivedathreatening
                letter.. He showed her the one he received and her letter was i
                - very similar if not identical to his letter. NURMELA advised, 1
                however, that the woman told him she was not going to do anything |
                about the letter and that she had already destroyed it or was
                going to destroy it. He advised that he uodld try to remember i
                Who this women was and give her identity to the Bureau. =
                NURMELA advised that he had no idea who might be responsible |
                for having written the anonymous letter. He stated that he |
                never lived in Chicago and in fact had never even been there. 1
                : He had never received any threatening letter before or since. .
                He took no part whatever in the recent election or the campaigns
                * other than to vote. |
                He advised that he knew MALVINA REYNOLDS because |

                CLARA W, EVANS advised that she had received a A
                . âthreatening type letter in about July of 1964. She recalled  Â»âÂ¢
                that she had received the letter the first Saturday of the |
                Republican convention in San Francisco. She pointed out Co
                that her brother was FRANK WILKINSON who had been active !
                in attempts to abolish the Committee on Un-American |
                Activities, and she felt this was the reason she had been
                + singled out to be sent this letter. She advised that  - .
                she had been very frightened by the receipt of the letter,
                . but she had no idea who could.have sent it to her, .. |
                Sbe advised that she had never lived in Chicago, A
                but had been through there several times when she was a . J

                letter in question. i
                She advised that many years ago she helped out !
                in some kind of Forum which supported some local teachers |
                Â© ina dispute they were having with the school district. She
                . received a letter through the mail during this period, but :
                this letter mainly questioned whether or not she was aware
                of the nature of the group she was supporting. She advised Lo
                . that the letter was not really threatening in natiwe, but
                rather an attempt to inform her of the questionable loyalties
                of the group. She advised that she had never received any y
                other threatening letter of any kind. .
                Irs, EVANS advised that she would be on the alert :
                for any information which might be of assistance in identifying
                the person who mailed this letter, She advised that she did :

                produce the letter and pass it around for all to read.

                -OIVA NURMELA registered as a communist voter in .
                1936, 1938, and 1941. He was active in the International
                Workers Order in Berkeley, California, in 1943, 1944, and 1947.
                He has been active in the Northern California Committee for
                the Protection of Foreign Born since 1953. He has also been :
                . a subscriber to the \"People\'s World\" since 1947, and has held
                benefit parties for the \"People\'s World\" in his home. In
                1956, he made a speech in which he was contemptuous of the
                United States and the Immigration Service: for the activity
                of Government Agents against foreign born people. NURMELA
                attended meetings to honor members of the National Committee,
                Communist Party, United States of America, in 1959.
                An FBI Agent attempted to interview NURMELA in
                1958, and he slammed the door in the Agent\'s face. After this  -
                attempted interview, OIVA NURMELA spoke in an extremely violent
                fashion as to what action he would take if interviewed by the
                FBI again. In 1962, he again expressÃ©d hatred for Government
                - Agents, and threatened violence if approached for interview.

                Illinois, were forwarded to te FBI Laboratory for comparison
                with other envelopes and cards previously submitted.

                By communication dated February 9, 1965, the FBI
                Laboratory reported as follows:

                \"It was found that the addresses on the envelopes
                designated as Q43, Q13, @23 and others were prepared on a
                typewriter or typewriters equipped with Underwood elite type,
                spaced twelve letters per inch. The typewriting is too limited
                to permit determination as to whether these addresses were pre-
                pared on the same typewriter. These envelopes are similar in
                size and style, and each bears a postage stamp commemorating -
                Sam Houston.
