                1 hr @ $50.00 - This fee includes the time spent on multiple searches to
                refine the original request per our exchanges to its current state of 636
                pages.  This work can only be done by one individual in the District and
                this is aligned to their hourly rate (slightly less).
                2.5 hrs. @ $75.00 - If you compare previous fee proposals you will see that
                the fees and time on task have been reduced accordingly.  This fee
                represents the amount of time that I, the FOIL officer, must spend
                reviewing all 636 pages before releasing them. This is a task designated to
                me and I am not comfortable having an employee unfamiliar with FOIL
                requests to conduct work, which is so critical to the requestor and the
                District.  The rate provided is less than my hourly rate, but fair

                RE: Request for Information under Michiganâs Freedom of
                Information Act
                Dear Adam Goldstein:
                This letter is in response to your request for information under the State of Michiganâs Freedom of 
                Information Act (âFOIAâ) received by Grand Rapids Community College (âGRCCâ or âCollegeâ) on 
                April 28, 2023.
                You requested the following information:
                [P]ayroll records (for all employees of your institution) from 1984 to 2022. The 
                information I am looking for is nonpersonal ([i.e.,] [n]ame, campus address and 
                telephone number, title, rate of pay, job description and date of hire). We would like 
                disaggregated figures, not aggregated. To assist in this process, I have listed with 
                more specificity, the information we are looking for:
                Non Personal records:
                â¢ Name (first and last)[;]
                â¢ Email[;]
                â¢ Title[;]
                â¢ Rate of pay (base pay, other pay, overtime pay, benefits, and total pay)[;]
                â¢ Job description[;]
                â¢ Date of hire[;]
                â¢ If the institution has a system of categorizing employees[,] please include their 
                categorization and corresponding codebook if relevant[;]
                â¢ Department and/or Area and/or Office[.]
                Pursuant to MCL 15.235(2), I am writing to inform you that your request will be granted in 
                part and denied in part. Pursuant to MCL 15.235(5), please allow this correspondence to serve to 
                inform you that the portions of your request which have been denied are as follows:
                Certain records from the period you requested do not exist within the Collegeâs 
                possession, custody or control, and cannot be provided because Grand Rapids 
                Community College was part of the Grand Rapids Public School system (âGRPSâ) until 

                1991. While employment records for pre-1991 employees who continued with GRCC 
                are within the Collegeâs possession and control, records of employees who separated 
                before 1991 would be within the exclusive possession and control of GRPS. 
                As set forth further below, the College will begin to fulfill the portions of your request which 
                have been granted upon receipt of a good-faith deposit which does not exceed fifty percent 
                (50%) of the Collegeâs fee calculation regarding this request.
                The FOIA provides that a public body may charge a fee for the search, retrieval, examination, review, 
                and separation and deletion of exempt from nonexempt material, where the failure to do so would 
                result in unreasonably high costs to the public body because of the nature of the request in the 
                particular instance and where the public body specifically identifies the nature of these 
                unreasonably high costs. See MCL 15.234(1), (3). 
                In this instance, fulfilling your request for the employment records of each employee who has 
                worked for GRCC for a period of thirty-eight (38) years (including annual compensation and benefit 
                information; contact information; and job descriptions) would result in an unreasonably high cost 
                to the College. The process involved with providing the records you have requested will include 
                searching for, retrieving, and examining voluminous employment records maintained and stored in 
                hard-copy formats, and in no less than three (3) electronic enterprise management systems. 
                Additionally, voluminous records currently in hard-copy formats will need to be duplicated or 
                published in electronic or digital formats in order to be made available. Finally, all of the 
                voluminous records the College anticipates would be responsive to your request will need to be 
                reviewed by College employee(s) to ensure the separation of exempt material from nonexempt 
                material.
                If, as here, GRCC estimates a fee to process a FOIA request will be greater than $50.00, the College 
                will require a good-faith deposit from the requester before providing the public records to the 
                requester. See MCL 15.234(8). Pursuant to the FOIA, the deposit request shall not exceed one-half 
                (1/2) of the total estimated fee, and any written notice must provide a best-efforts estimate by GRCC 
                regarding the time frame after the deposit is received that it will take GRCC to provide the public 
                records to the requestor. Id.
                In this instance, GRCC has reviewed your request and has determined that the estimated cost 
                to comply with fulfilling your entire request would be $82,702.80. The following is a 
                breakdown regarding how this cost was determined:

                Labor:
                Searching for, locating, and examining the material:
                No. of Hours: 1,280 hours
                Wage Rate1: $30.66 per hour 
                Fringe Multiplier2: 1.50
                1,280 hours x $30.66 per hour x 1.50 fringe multiplier = $58,867.20
                Reviewing the material, including separating exempt from non-exempt 
                material:
                No. of Hours: 320 hours
                Wage Rate: $30.66 per hour 
                Fringe Multiplier: 1.50
                320 hours x $30.66 per hour x 1.50 fringe multiplier = $14,716.80
                Duplication or publication (including making digital copies or transferring 
                public records to digital or electronic formats):
                No. of Hours: 240 hours
                Wage Rate $25.33 per hour 
                Fringe Multiplier: 1.50
                240 hours x $25.33 per hours x 1.50 fringe multiplier = $9,118.80
                Postage: No fee.
                Non-Paper Physical Media: No fee.
                ________________________________________
                1 All wage rates in the itemized fee calculation are based on the rate for the lowest-paid College 
                employee who is capable of performing this work.
                2 A public body may add up to fifty percent (50%) of the applicable labor charge amount to 
                cover or partially cover the cost of fringe benefits.

                Pursuant to MCL 15.234(8), GRCC is requesting a good-faith deposit in the amount of 
                $41,000.00 before providing the public records you requested. The deposit fee may be made 
                payable to âGrand Rapids Community Collegeâ and may be sent to the following address:
                Attn: FOIA Coordinator
                Grand Rapids Community College
                143 Bostwick Ave NE
                Grand Rapids, MI 49503
                If the requested deposit is not received by GRCC within forty-five (45) days of the date of your 
                receipt of this correspondence, and if you have not filed an appeal regarding the deposit amount, 
                your request will be considered abandoned pursuant to MCL 15.234(14).
                GRCC estimates that, upon receipt of the deposit, it will require approximately one hundred 
                and fifty (150) business days to provide you with the public records you have requested.
                This correspondence will confirm that, with respect to the Collegeâs fee and deposit request, you 
                have the right to do the following under the FOIA:
                1. Within forty-five (45) days, submit to the President of Grand Rapids Community College a 
                written appeal that specifically states the word âappealâ and identifies the reason or reasons 
                why the required fee identified in this correspondence exceeds the amount permitted under 
                GRCCâs available procedures and guidelines or Section 4 (MCL 15.234) of the FOIA.
                2. Within forty-five (45) days of receiving a determination of an appeal to the President of 
                Grand Rapids Community College, commence an action for a fee reduction in an appropriate 
                court.
                You may have the right to receive attorneyâs fees and damages if, after judicial review, a court 
                determines that Grand Rapids Community College has not complied with the requirements of the 
                FOIA with respect to its fee calculation.
                Finally, pursuant to the FOIA please allow this correspondence to confirm that, with respect to the 
                Collegeâs partial denial of your request, you have the right to do either of the following:
                1. Within 180 days, submit to the President of Grand Rapids Community College a written 
                appeal that specifically states the word âappealâ and identifies the reason or reasons for 
                reversal of any denial of your request; or
                2. Within 180 days, commence an action in an appropriate court to compel disclosure of any 
                public records request that was denied.

                You have the right to receive attorneyâs fees and damages if, after judicial review, a court determines 
                that Grand Rapids Community College has not complied with the requirements of the FOIA and 
                orders disclosure of all or a portion of the requested public record(s). See MCL 15.235(5)(e).

                RE: Freedom of Information Act Request A23-02081 Date March 6, 2023 Concerning City of 
                Detroit Records Pertaining to Any Use of Force
                Dear Mr. Lowery:
                This letter serves as the City of Detroitâs supplemental response to the above-referenced matter. Your 
                request was received by the City of Detroit Freedom of Information Act Section, via email, on March 6, 2023. 
                Because your request was received by electronic transmission, pursuant to Section 5(1) of the Michigan 
                Freedom of Information Act (the âActâ), MCL 15.235(1); your request is deemed to have been received at the 
                Law Department on the next business day, March 7, 2023. In accordance with Section 5(2)(d) of the Act, MCL 
                15.235(2)(d), we sent a letter extending our time to respond until March 28, 2023. The City provided its initial 
                response on March 29, 2023. Thank you for your patience.
                Your letter requests:
                âAll police incident reports /investigative reports connected to any use of 
                force incident by officers in your department between January 1, 2020 and 
                December 31, 2022.â
                The record from the Detroit Police Department (DPD) which corresponds to your request, consists of four 
                thousand and nineteen (4019) pages. DPD Office of Internal Affairs indicated that it took 25 hours at a rate of 
                $35.97 per hour to comply with your request. In addition, City of Detroit Law Department personnel must 
                conduct a line-by-line review of the record in order to separate the exempt from non-exempt information before 
                releasing the record. A conservative estimate of sixty-five (65) hours is needed to perform the necessary review 
                and redactions by the Law Department personnel. The hourly rate of the lowest paid Law Department personnel 
                who is capable of such a review and redaction is $33.60 per hour. Therefore, the City will incur an adjusted 
                estimated labor cost in the amount of Three Thousand Nine Hundred and Twenty-Nine 86/100 Dollars 
                ($3,929.86) [25 hours x $35.97/hr plus 65 hours x $33.60/hr plus fringe benefits reduced by 5% due to delay in 
                response] in order to comply with your request. Please see attached updated FOIA Fee Estimate form.
                Accordingly, pursuant to MCL 15.234(8), we require that you provide a deposit in the amount of One
                Thousand Nine Hundred and Sixty-Four 93/100 Dollars ($1,964.93) [$3,929.86 divided by 2]. However, we 
                are in receipt of a prior deposit in the amount of $916.64. Therefore, the balance of the deposit owed is
                $1,048.29 [$1,964.93-$916.64]. Please submit said amount in the form of a money order or check made payable 
                to the \"City of Detroit\". Also, let me know by June 21, 2023 as to how you wish to proceed in this matter. 
                Additionally, include the FOIA request number listed above on the memo line of your check/money order 
                or on a separate note and forward to my attention. It is important to note that we do not accept cash. Please 
                do not write on the check outside of the memo line as our bank will not process checks with writing 
                outside of the memo line. Failure to comply with these policies will result in your check being returned 
                to you.

                Upon receipt of the payment, in accordance with MCL 15.234(1) and (3), we will commence the review 
                and the separation of the exempt information from the non-exempt information and provide you with a 
                supplemental response letter which outlines what information has been exempted from the record and the legal 
                justification for the exemption. We expect that the review of the record will be complete within six months of 
                receipt of your deposit. Please note that if we are not in receipt of your deposit by the above-referenced date, 
                we shall consider your request abandoned and close our file on this request, pursuant to MCL 15.234(14).
                Please be advised that, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the City of Detroit Law Department would 
                prefer that all letters, payments and other correspondence pertaining to new or pending FOIA requests be sent 
                via email or the U.S. mail. We will send all correspondence to members of the public via U.S. Mail and/or 
                email as appropriate. Please contact Jack Dietrich at 313-237-5030, if this policy creates a hardship for you. 
                Thank you in advance for your compliance with this policy.
                Please note that pursuant to Section 10 and 10a of the Act, MCL 15.240 and 15.240a, a person receiving 
                a written denial of a request or receiving a letter to submit the labor costs may do one of the following:
                1) Submit a written appeal to the head of the public body denying the request. Such appeal, if 
                submitted, should specifically state the word âappealâ and identify the reason or reasons for 
                reversal of the disclosure denial. MCL 15.240(1)(a) and MCL 15.240a(1)(a); or
                2) Commence an action in the circuit court to compel the disclosure of the public records within 180 
                days after the public bodyâs denial of the request, MCL 15.240(1)(b), or 45 days after the public 
                bodyâs request for labor costs, MCL 15.240a(1)(b). If a court finds that the information withheld 
                by a public body is not exempt from disclosure, or that the labor costs requested by the public body 
                exceeds the amount permitted, the requesting party may receive the requested record and, at the 
                discretion of the court, reasonable attorney fees and /or cost. MCL 15.240(6) and (7), and MCL 
                15.240a(6) and (7).

                Re: Freedom Of Information Act regarding Emphasys Software Products
                Dear Mr. Feathers:
                On May 8, 2023, the staff of the Michigan State Housing Development Authority 
                (âAuthorityâ) received your request for the above referenced documents and 
                information under the Michigan Freedom of Information Act (âFOIAâ). 
                Your request is granted as to the existing, nonexempt records in the possession 
                of the Authority falling within the scope of your request. 
                Fees are permitted to be charged for providing information under the FOIA. 
                A Detailed Itemization of Fees (the âItemizationâ) for your request has been 
                attached to this letter. The estimated cost to complete your request is $1950.00. 
                Please note that the Itemization is only an estimate and actual costs may vary 
                depending on the actual amount of time spent collecting the information or 
                monitoring an inspection. Should you request physical copies of documents, the 
                cost will be $0.10 per page.
                Please provide a deposit of $975.00 to the Authority to proceed in processing your 
                request. Upon receipt of your deposit, the Authority will complete the processing 
                of your request and will notify you of any balance due. The Authority requires the 
                payment in full of all fees incurred in processing a FOIA request before delivering 
                the responsive public records. The Authority estimates that it shall deliver the 
                responsive documents to you within ten (10) business days of the receipt of your 
                full payment.
                Please note that this request will be considered abandoned if we do not receive 
                your deposit within forty-five (45) days and the Authority will no longer be required 
                to fulfill the request.

                Finally, it is our policy to redact all personal information from requested 
                documentation unless we are in receipt of a waiver. 
                The Authorityâs Freedom of Information Act Procedures and Guidelines can be

                personally identifiable information such as employee social security numbers, home addresses,

                this request. Please provide a fee deposit of $40,800.92 (50% of $81,601.83) by check made
                payable to Henry Ford College and send to the attention of Caryne DeMatteo within 45 days of
                this letter (July 5, 2023). If the College does not receive your deposit within 45 days of this leter,

                on gathering the extensive FOIA information you requested once enabled to do so and anticipates
                having those records available to you within one hundred and twenty (120) business days after
                receiving the required fee deposit. The good faith monetary and time estimates are subject
                to College modification once the compilation and review of this extensive and multiyear request
                is underway and through completion.

                Dear Adam,



                Please be advised that Delta College received your electronic FOIA request dated, Friday, April 28, 2023, on Monday, May 1, in which you requested the following:



                “…payroll records (for all employees of your institution) from 1984 to 2022. The information I am looking for is nonpersonal (i.e.: Name, campus address and telephone number, title, rate of pay, job description and date of hire). We would like disaggregated figures, not aggregated. To assist in this process, I have listed with more specificity, the information we are looking for:

                Non-Personal records:

                Name (first and last)

                Email

                Title

                Rate of pay (base pay, other pay, overtime pay, benefits, and total pay)

                Job description

                Date of hire

                If the institution has a system of categorizing employees please include their categorization and corresponding codebook if relevant.

                Date Detailed Costs Itemization Mailed: _________________________
                The following costs are being charged in compliance with Section 4 of the Michigan Freedom of Information Act, MCL 
                15.234, according to the Collegeâs FOIA Policies and Guidelines.
                1. Labor Cost for Copying / Duplication
                This is the cost of labor directly associated with duplication of publication, including making
                paper copies, making digital copies, or transferring digital public records to be given to the
                requestor on non-paper physical media or through the Internet or other electronic means as
                stipulated by the requestor.
                This shall not be more than the hourly wage of the Collegeâs lowest-paid employee capable of 
                necessary duplication or publication in this particular instance, regardless of whether that 
                person is available or who actually performs the labor. 
                These costs will be estimated and charged in 15 minute time increments. All partial time 
                increments must be rounded down. If the number of minutes is less than one increment, there is 
                no charge.
                Hourly Wage with Fringe Benefit Cost: $_
                Multiply the hourly wage by the percentage multiplier: ______%
                (up to 50% of the hourly wage) and add to the hourly wage for a total per hour rate.

                15
                2. Labor Cost to Locate
                This is the cost of labor directly associated with the necessary searching for, locating, and
                examining public records in conjunction with receiving and fulfilling a granted written request.
                This fee is being charged because failure to do so will result in unreasonably high costs to the 
                College that are excessive and beyond the normal or usual amount for those services 
                compared to the Collegeâs usual FOIA requests, because of the nature of the request in this 
                particular instance, specifically: _________________________ creating a report to pull the information requested from our database. This __________________________
                ___________________ was a more timely approach than providing database tables. ___________________________________________________________ 
                ______________________________________________________________________________ 
                The College will not charge more than the hourly wage of its lowest-paid employee capable of 
                searching for, locating, and examining the public records in this particular instance, regardless of 
                whether that person is available or who actually performs the labor. 
                These costs will be estimated and charged in 15-minute time increments (must be 15-minutes 
                or more); all partial time increments must be rounded down. If the number of minutes is less 
                than 15, there is no charge.
                Hourly Wage with Fringe Benefit Cost: $________ $41.51, Hourly rate is $27.67
                Multiply the hourly wage by the percentage multiplier: __150____%
                (up to 50% of the hourly wage) and add to the hourly wage for a total per hour rate. 
                10.38 160 $1,660.80
                Hourly wage of $27.67 w/benefit cap 150% = $41.51/4 = $10.38
                2,400
                15
                Hourly wage of $10.10/4 = $2.53 160 2.53 404.80
                3a. Employee Labor Cost for Separating Exempt from Non-Exempt (Redacting) 
                (Fill this out if using a College employee. If contracted, use No. 3b instead).
                The College will not charge for labor directly associated with redaction if it knows or has reason 
                to know that it previously redacted the record in question and still has the redacted version in 
                its possession. 
                This fee is being charged because failure to do so will result in unreasonably high costs to the 
                College that are excessive and beyond the normal or usual amount for those services 
                compared to the Collegeâs usual FOIA requests, because of the nature of the request in this 
                particular instance, specifically: ___________________________________________________
                ______________________________________________________________________________ 
                ______________________________________________________________________________ 
                This is the cost of labor of a College employee, including necessary review, directly associated 
                with separating and deleting exempt from nonexempt information. This shall not be more than 
                the hourly wage of the Collegeâs lowest-paid employee capable of separating and deleting 
                exempt from nonexempt information in this particular instance, regardless of whether that 
                person is available or who actually performs the labor. 
                These costs will be estimated and charged in 15 minute time increments; all partial time 
                increments must be rounded down. If the number of minutes is less than 15, there is no charge.
                Hourly Wage with Fringe Benefit Cost: $_______ 10.10, hourly rate with no benefits _
                Multiply the hourly wage by the percentage multiplier: __0__%
                (up to 50% of the hourly wage) and add to the hourly wage for a total per hour rate. 
                the redaction of personal employee information.
                Paper records must be copied to regular paper size and
                scanned as applicable.

                3b. Contracted Labor Cost for Separating Exempt from Non-Exempt (Redacting)
                (Fill this out if using a contractor, such as the attorney. If using in-house employee, use No. 3a 
                instead.)
                The College will not charge for labor directly associated with redaction if it knows or has reason 
                to know that it previously redacted the record in question and still has the redacted version in 
                its possession.
                This fee is being charged because failure to do so will result in unreasonably high costs to the 
                College that are excessive and beyond the normal or usual amount for those services 
                compared to the Collegeâs usual FOIA requests, because of the nature of the request in this 
                particular instance, specifically: ____________________________________________________
                ______________________________________________________________________________
                ______________________________________________________________________________
                As this College does not employ a person capable of separating exempt from non-exempt 
                information in this particular instance, as determined by the FOIA Coordinator, this is the cost of 
                labor of a contractor (i.e.: outside attorney), including necessary review, directly associated with 
                separating and deleting exempt information from nonexempt information. This shall not exceed 
                an amount equal to 6 times the state minimum hourly wage rate.
                Name of contracted person or firm: ________________________________________________
                These costs will be estimated and charged in 15-minute time increments (must be 15-minutes 
                or more); all partial time increments must be rounded down. If the number of minutes is less 
                than 15, there is no charge.
                Hourly Cost Charged: $________ Charge per increment: $_________
                To figure the

                4. Copying / Duplication Cost
                Copying costs may be charged if a copy of a public record is requested, or for the necessary
                copying of a record for inspection (for example, to allow for blacking out exempt information, to
                protect old or delicate original records, or because the original record is a digital file or database
                not available for public inspection).
                No more than the actual cost of a sheet of paper, up to maximum 10 cents per sheet for:
