                Dear Mr. Seitz:
                This acknowledges receipt of your Freedom of Information/Privacy Acts (FOIPA) request to the

                Your request has been received at FBI Headquarters for processing.
                You submitted your request via the FBIâs eFOIPA system.
                Future correspondence about your FOIPA request will be provided in an email 
                link unless the record file type is not supported by the eFOIPA system.

                \"To Whom It May Concern:

                Pursuant to the Montana Freedom of Information Act, I hereby request the following records:

                We are aware that air quality management agencies sometimes conduct \"exceptional event demonstrations,\" which are analyses to demonstrate that emissions from potential exceptional events caused an exceedance of one or more NAAQS. These demonstrations are then submitted to the Regional EPA office in order to request that the office exclude the air quality monitoring data from use in certain regulatory determinations.

                Concerning services related to these exceptional event analyses, we request:
                1. Any and all executed contracts, memorandums of understanding (MOUs), or other equivalent agreements that are currently active, or have been active within the last five years;
                2. Any addenda, amendments, attachments, exhibits, materials, and schedules;
                3. Any and all correspondence, between the relevant air quality agency and the contracting individual, corporation, or other entity, related to the implementation of these agreements.

                The requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.

                In the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.

                Thank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 10 business days.

                Sincerely,

                RE: Your California Public Records Act request dated March 15, 2023
                Dear Todd Feathers:
                On March 15, 2023, EDD received the following request for Public Records from you:
                For each algorithmic tool your agency has used since Jan. 1, 2018, I request the 
                following records:
                1) Executive summaries, project overviews, or comparable records that describe the 
                scope and purpose of the algorithmic tool.
                2) Contracts, statements of work, successful RFP submissions and bid packets, or 
                comparable records that describe the purchase and/or construction of the algorithmic 
                tool.
                3) User handbooks, guides, training manuals, agency policies, or comparable records 
                that describe the toolâs functions and its appropriate uses.
                Pursuant to California Government Code section 7922.535, EDD has determined that up to 
                an additional fourteen (14) days will be required to properly determine if disclosable public 
                records are in the possession of EDD. This additional time is needed to search for, collect, 
                and appropriately examine a voluminous amount of separate and distinct records.
                If you have any questions, please contact me at nicholas.scheuer@edd.ca.gov.
                Sincerely,

                    communication="""Dear Matthew,

                Per your request of May 22, 2023, I have updated your FOIA request, FOIA
                tracking number *RD 77093*, to reflect that you narrowed your request to
                FBI case file *100-MI-15812 *(I have also removed FBI case
                file 100A-BA-25222 from your request). Since your request does not exceed
                700 pages, I have reassigned it to our *first-tier processing queue*.
                Taking into consideration our existing backlog, we *estimate* it will take*
                39 months* to complete processing.

                Records transferred to the custody of the National Archives are exempt from
                the fee and fee waiver provisions of the Freedom of Information Act because
                a fee schedule was in effect prior to enactment. The applicable section
                states that “nothing in this subparagraph shall supersede fees chargeable
                under a statute specifically providing for setting the level of fees for
                particular types of records” (5 U.S.C. 552 (a)(4)(A)(vi)). The relevant fee
                statute authorizes the National Archives “to charge a fee for making or
                authenticating copies or reproductions of materials transferred to the
                Archivist’s custody.” (44 U.S.C. 2116(c)). The inability to grant the
                requested fee waiver does not constitute a denial under the terms of the
                Freedom of Information Act.


                In the future, someone from our office will contact you to inform you that
                a line-by-line review of the case file has been completed. At that point,
                you will have the option to order a copy for a fee of 80 cents per page or
                view the record in-person.


                If you visit the National Archives at College Park, Maryland, we will save
                a digital surrogate of the original record (this will be the reviewed copy
                that may include redactions) to a CD and you will be able to view the file*
                at no cost*. If you need to use one of our public access computers you will
                need to bring a universal serial bus (USB) drive so that you will be able
                to download a copy. You also have the option of bringing your own personal
                laptop that has a CD-Drive in order to copy the file(s) that way.

                Due to the size and number of custodians of your requests, as the coordinator I have been unable to determine the exact associated fees. Yet, I am submitting the below as estimated cost subject to be modified once all documentation has been compiled and submitted.

                In accordance with Policy<chrome-extension://efaidnbmnnnibpcajpcglclefindmkaj/https:/andersoncountytn.gov/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Anderson-County-Public-Records-Policy.pdf> stated below and subject to your prior waiver of inspection of records, the cost associated with the electronic copies reimbursement of a thumb drive is $2.70 per drive. Additionally, the current associated cost for retrieving, redacting, etc. is $122, which is subject to increase based upon the remaining custodian’s submission of time spent compiling. If you request the thumb drive(s) be mailed to your Kingston Springs, TN address rather than retrieving in person, you are also required to cover the cost of shipping. Once the exact amount can be determined, I will notify a detailed cost amount. If electing to receive the data via United States Postal Service, we will mail the thumb drive(s) once the check payment has been received.

                This Office is moving forward with your request and will contact you on or around May 30th to discuss the process you wish to move forward with in receiving your requested documentation.

                Feel free to contact me if you have further questions or concerns before then.
