                Dear Mr. Thompson:
                This is the final agency decision issued under the Freedom of Information Act 
                (FOIA), 5 U.S.C. Â§ 552, in response to your appeal from the initial agency decision 
                issued by the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Office of General Counsel (OGC). 
                For the reasons outlined below, your appeal is denied. 
                Procedural History
                Initial request On January 3, 2022, you submitted a FOIA request for the 
                following information: 
                Copies of any and all Settlement Agreement(s) of the 
                Valentini v. Shinseki Federal Court Case(s) and its related 
                Action(s), that were entered into by and between the 
                Plaintiff(s) and Defendant(s) in that Case; wherever such 
                Agreement(s) to any of the aforementioned Case(s) and 
                Action(s) exist, if any.
                You provided background regarding your request, including that âValentini v. Shinseki 
                is a Civil Rights Case filed in the Federal Court for the Central District of California in 
                2011 under Case Number 2:11-cv-04846â and that VA is one of the Defendants in the 
                case. You claimed that there is no settlement agreement entered or â[n]oticed to the 
                Valentini Court and / or Entered upon itâs Docket(s)â despite a âFinal Judgment Order of 
                February 17th, 2015 in That Case expressly Orders âShould this matter fail to resolve 
                itself, the Court shall reinstate all previously issued order.ââ 

                Fees VAâs FOIA regulations require each request to be characterized under 38 
                C.F.R. Â§ 1.561(c) and fees to be estimated and charged, when applicable. Your request 
                was characterized as a âNews Mediaâ requester. You were not charged any fees for the 
                processing of this request. 
                Search On January 6, 2022, OGC FOIA Officer Gregory Draves requested 
                responsive records from the Real Property Law Group (RPLG), which is the practice 
                group within OGC that worked on the Valentini litigation. The RPLG attorney assigned 
                to the litigation searched Outlook for the terms âValentini settlementâ and âValentini v. 
                Shinseki.â The search produced a copy of the 2015 settlement agreement and a 
                restatement of the settlement agreement executed by the parties in 2017. The attorney 
                also noted that the 2015 agreement is publicly available at the following address: 
                https://www.westladraftmasterplan.org/documentation/extra-info. 
                Initial Agency Decision (IAD) On January 11, 2021, Mr. Draves issued an IAD, 
                notifying you that responsive records had been located. He identified two (2) 
                documents, totaling seven (7) pages, as responsive to your request. He provided the 
                two documents to you in their entirety. You were also provided with the appropriate 
                appeal, mediation, and public liaison rights. 
                Responsive Records The documents disclosed to you consisted of (1) 
                Restatement of Settlement Agreement (dated January 12, 2017) â four (4) pages; and 
                (2) Principles for a Partnership and Framework for Settlement By and Between the U.S. 
                Department of Veterans Affairs (dated January 28, 2015) â three (3) pages. 
                Appeal In a letter dated March 8, 2022, and received in our office on March 23, 
                2022, you appealed the full grant IAD. You argued that the document dated January 28, 
                2015, is not a settlement agreement because it âdoes not state nor stipulate anywhere 
                therein, that it is the very Settlement Agreement to any Federal Action whatsoeverâ and 
                it is âexpressly not enforceable in any court, about various expectations, between 
                persons who were not Plaintiffs in Valentini v. Shinsekiâ¦â 
                You also questioned the responsiveness of the document dated January 12, 
                2017. You wrote that it refers to an agreement signed on January 28, 2015, and you 
                claim that âno such referred-to agreement exists, unless it has never been Released to 
                the Publicâ¦â You also write that even if it did exist, it is not a settlement agreement in 
                Valentini v. Shinseki because the plaintiffs in Valentini v. Shineski âare not a private nonï¿¾profit corporation named Vets Advocacy.â You also claim that neither of the two 
                signatories to the document, Ronald Olson and Ann Brown, are party to the Valentini v. 
                Shineski litigation. 
                You also claim that the two documents âdo not appear to be registered and 
                accepted by the Valentini Court on the Federal Docket of that Action. In fact, the Case 
                Record Notices, well after January 15, 2015 â that the actual parties to Valentini v. 
                Shinseki purportedly intended to stipulate to settle in the future.â You also stated that âit 

                appears the Plaintiffs in the Action were never present in session after they Prevailed, 
                as in Won the Case, in Fall of 2013.â 
                Relevant Law We have thoroughly reviewed your appeal under the provisions of the 
                FOIA, which provides that federal agencies must disclose records requested unless 
                they may be withheld in accordance with one or more of nine statutory exemptions. 5 
                U.S.C. Â§ 552(b).
                Analysis You appear to question the adequacy of the records search and whether the 
                documents provided to you are, in fact, the documents you requested. Mr. Draves 
                contacted an OGC attorney with first-hand knowledge of the Valentini litigation, who 
                searched for and located the two (2) settlement agreements. We believe the efforts 
                taken to locate the documents you seek were sufficient to satisfy the duty of the 
                Department under the FOIA to conduct a reasonable search. 
                Furthermore, we have examined both documents and the docket history for Case 
                No. 2:11-cv-04846 in the U.S. District Court for the Central District of California. Based 
                on our careful review, we conclude that the two (2) documents are responsive to, and 
                fulfill, your request. We address each of your arguments, below, in turn.
                You identify three (3) alleged issues with the January 28, 2015 (âJanuary 2015â) 
                document. You state that it is not a settlement agreement because âit does not state or 
                stipulate anywhere therein, that it is the very Settlement Agreement to any Federal 
                Action whatsoeverâ¦â Please note that the preamble of the document states that it is 
                between the VA and representatives of the plaintiffs in the Valentini case. Paragraph 5 
                of the document also states that the parties will file a joint motion in the District Court 
                âfor an indicative ruling that, in light of the partiesâ commitment to work as partners, the 
                District court would vacate its judgment in Valentini v. McDonald . . . and coordinate to 
                file additional pleadings . . . as well as pleadings necessary to effect a dismissal without 
                prejudice of the entire actionâ¦â That the January 2015 document does not contain your 
                preferred specific wording does not mean it is not a settlement agreement. You also 
                take issue with the fact that Paragraph 14 of the document states that it is ânot intended 
                to be enforceable in any courtâ¦â We note that lack of enforceability in court does not 
                negate the fact that the January 2015 document is a settlement agreement, which 
                ultimately resulted in the case being dismissed. Finally, you argue that the January 2015 
                document is âbetween persons who were not Plaintiffsâ in the litigation. Please note that 
                attorney Ronald Olson signed the agreement âon behalf of all plaintiffsâ and, as such, it 
                was not necessary for each individual plaintiff to sign.
                We further direct your attention to the docket for Case No. 2:11-cv-04846 in the 
                U.S. District Court for the Central District of California. As discussed in the January 
                2015 document, Electronic Court Filing (ECF) 188 is a Notice of Motion and Joint Motion 
                for Order for Indicative Ruling Pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 62.1. The document states: 
                âThe Plaintiffs and Government Defendants (the âmoving partiesâ) have recently reached 
                agreement to work together in partnership to address these important challenges rather 

                than continue this litigation.â ECF 196 is a Joint Stipulation to Dismiss Case, which 
                states: âThe parties further stipulate that this dismissal shall be without prejudice, and 
                that each party shall bear its own costs. The reasons for this dismissal have been set 
                forth previously in the Joint Motion To Vacate Judgment Pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 
                60(b), ECF 193, as well as in the Joint Motion for Indicative Ruling Pursuant to Fed. R. 
                Civ. P. 62.1, ECF 188, and have been addressed in the Courtâs orders granting the 
                above-referenced motions. See Order, February 17, 2015, ECF 194; Order, February 
                3, 2015, ECF 189.â If you have further questions regarding the January 2015 settlement 
                agreement and the conclusion of the litigation, we suggest you review the 
                aforementioned court filings. 
                You also identified three (3) alleged issues with the January 12, 2017 (âJanuary
                2017â) document. You wrote that the January 2017 document references an agreement 
                signed on January 28, 2015, that does not exist, unless it has never been publicly 
                released. The referenced January 28, 2015, document is the previously discussed
                January 2015 settlement agreement that was disclosed to you. You also suggest that 
                the January 2017 document is not a settlement in the Valentini case because the 
                plaintiffs in Valentini âare not a private non-profit corporation named Vets Advocacy.â
                Per the January 2015 settlement, the Plaintiffsâ representatives formed a non-profit 
                corporation âto help meet the objective and goalsâ of the January 2015 settlement. That 
                non-profit is Vets Advocacy. You also claim that neither of the two (2) signatories to the 
                document, Mr. Ronald Olson and Ms. Ann Brown, are party to the Valentini litigation.
                Mr. Olson, who signed the January 2015 agreement on behalf of all plaintiffs, signed 
                the January 2017 agreement as a representative of Vets Advocacy, where he serves 
                on the Board of Directors. Ms. Brown signed the agreement in her capacity as the VA 
                Medical Center Director, on behalf of the VA, who was a party to the litigation. 
                We would also like to direct your attention to publicly available information 
                regarding the settlement and the Valentini litigation. As the RPLG attorney noted, 
                settlement information is available on the VA Greater Los Angeles Healthcare System 
                Draft Master Plan website. See https://www.westladraftmasterplan.org/. On the âAboutâ 
                page, the timeline includes a link to the Valentini v. McDonald settlement in the â1st
                Quarter 2015.â See https://www.westladraftmasterplan.org/about. The site describes 
                the settlement as follows: âOn January 28, 2015, former VA Secretary Robert McDonald 
                settled a class action lawsuit against the Department of Veterans Affairs alleging VA 
                was mismanaging the West LA Campus, by allowing commercial uses of land versus 
                using the land to support and care for our nationâs Veterans. VA and representatives of 
                the plaintiffs pledged to work together as partners to end veteran homelessness in the 
                Greater Los Angeles area.â On the âLibraryâ page, under âSource & Update Documentsâ 
                and then âBackground Information,â there are links to both âSettlement Agreement â
                2015â and âRestatement of Settlement Agreement â 2017â for download. See
                https://www.westladraftmasterplan.org/documentation/extra-info. They are the same 
                documents that were disclosed to you.

                Additionally, the Vets Advocacy website states that it is a ânon-profit organization 
                facilitating revitalization of the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs West Los Angeles 
                campus as a condition of the Valentini v. Shinseki settlement.â See
                https://www.vatherightway.org/vets-advocacy/. On that same website, when you click 
                on âSettlement Agreementâ on the timeline for January 2015, the following description 
                appears: âVA Secretary Bob McDonald and Plaintiff Partners sign the âPrinciples for 
                Partnership and Framework for Settlementâ agreement which called for the creation of 
                a veterans homelessness strategy, mutual cooperation in the development of a Master 
                Plan to set out the most effective use of the campus for veterans, development of an 
                exit strategy for leases not pertaining to veteran healthcare or housing and the creation 
                of a non-profit entity (Vets Advocacy) to assist in such efforts. Both parties also agreed 
                to file a joint motion to the District Court that would vacate its judgment in Valentini v. 
                McDonald.â A link to the January 28, 2015, document is also available. 
                Conclusion Based upon the foregoing, your appeal is denied.
                Mediation and Appeal Rights This final agency decision concludes the 
                administrative processing of your appeal.
                As part of the 2007 FOIA amendments, the Office of Government Information 
                Services (OGIS) was created to offer mediation services. Similarly, as part of the FOIA
                Improvement Act of 2016, VA established a FOIA Public Liaison to offer mediation 
                services. Both OGIS and the VA Public Liaison will assist in resolving disputes between 
                FOIA requesters and VA as a non-exclusive alternative to litigation. Using OGIS or the
                VA FOIA Public Liaison does not affect your right to pursue litigation. You may contact 
                OGIS or the VA Public Liaison in any of the following ways:
