  "input": "Good Afternoon Madam Kane,\r\nThe Department of Mineral Resources submitted your communications request to our state's Information Technology Department. They ran the related query and returned 297 emails to our agency meeting the criteria. Our estimate of reviewing the emails is 30 seconds per instance as many have attachments that will need to be looked at.\r\nThe first hour of locating requested records is free and has already occurred. The review for potential redaction of protected information, if any is present, is estimated to take an additional 1 Â¼ hours (at $25/hour) resulting in a charge of $31.25\r\nIf you would like to proceed with this request, please let us know and we will arrange invoicing and payment. If you want to proceed with the request and the amount of time reviewing the emails differs from the estimate, we will refund any overages.\r\n\r\n\r\nRespectfully,\nBridget Danso\r\nPublic Information Officer"
