I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 3 business days, as the statute requires.\n\n\n\nThere will be a cost of $50 per hour to try and fulfill your request.  I have no way of knowing what the total cost will be in advance as I do not have any idea how long it will take to compile your stats.  I have no idea how complete our stats will be on this so some of your requested data may not be completed.  If you are willing to proceed with that cost please let me know.  I look forward to awaiting your reply.\n\n\n\nRay Mattas\n\nSupport Services Captain\n\nCity of Emporia - Police Department\n\n518 Mechanic St., Emporia, KS 66801|620-341-4353\n\nrmattas@emporiaks.gov<mailto:rmattas@emporiaks.gov>\n\n\n\n\n\nCONFIDENTIALITY NOTICE -- This e-mail transmission and any documents, files or previous e-mail messages attached to it may contain confidential or legally privileged information.
