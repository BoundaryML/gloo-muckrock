  "input": "Good Morning,\n\nI was able to talk to our Captain who will be researching the information for this request. He estimates it will take a minimum of 20 hours and possibly, due to his workload several weeks  to compile the requested information. Our fee is $18.00 an hour for research and compilation. Keep in mind it could take longer than the 20 hours thus increasing the final cost. I also want to let you know this would only cover the years from 2020-2022. There is no information for the years 2017-2021 due to this information was not tracked.\n\nPlease let me know how you wish to proceed.\n\nThank you.\n\n\nMelissa Robinson\nHPD Records supervisor\nOffice 620-694-2865\nFax 620-694-2862\n210 w 1st ave, Hutchinson ks 67501\nHpdrecords@renolec.com<https://www.hutchgov.com/214/Police-Department>\n"
