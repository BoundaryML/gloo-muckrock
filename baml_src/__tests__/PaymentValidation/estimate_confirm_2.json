  "input": "Hi Julia,\r\n\r\nIn response to your request to narrow the scope of your request, and to answer your questions:\r\n\r\nIT Staff Set Up Fee - Your request will require two separate email searches for IT which will take an hour for each. Narrowing search terms and email addresses will not reduce this specific portion of the labor estimate.\r\n\r\nAdministrative Staff/Bureau Staff â€“ once the email search has concluded, Admin Staff and Bureau Staff must then sort through the emails to determine what is responsive, non-responsive, and what may be exempt according to Idaho state law. The current labor estimate quotes 1 hour for bureau staff and 3 hours for administrative staff. The reduction in IDL email addresses to be searched from 8 to 3 should reduce this workload, but note the three remaining IDL email addresses are expected to generate the highest volumes of communication so it will not proportionally reduce the cost estimate. The second part you requested to narrow will not reduce the cost estimate, unless you are able to eliminate some of the email extensions as keywords, i.e., remove @ipaa.org, @ingaa.org, etc.; otherwise, it will not reduce the amount of time staff spends on sorting emails.\r\n\r\nAttorney General Staff - An attorney will need to review any potential exemptions. Reducing the IDL emails to be searched from 8 to 3 reduces the attorney labor estimate per the new cost estimate attached.\r\n\r\nI attached a new cost estimate with your requested reductions. Please let me know if you want to move forward with your narrowed request, your original request, or if you want to make further changes to your request.\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Idaho Department of Lands logo]\r\nCameron Swisher\r\nPRR Coordinator\r\nIdaho Department of Lands\r\n300 N. 6th Street, Ste 103\r\nBoise, ID 83702\r\nOffice: (208) 334-0214\r\nEmail: public_records_request@idl.idaho.gov<mailto:public_records_request@idl.idaho.gov>\r\nhttps://www.idl.idaho.gov<https://www.idl.idaho.gov/>\n\nAttached Correspondence:\nREQUESTER NAME\nPRR DUE\nFILL IN ALL APPLICABLE HIGHLIGHTED AREAS\nCOPY/SCAN \nESTIMATE Copies Copy Rate Cost\nBureau $0.10 $ -\nArea $0.10 $ -\nOversize Copy/Scan \nFees and/or USB $5.00 $ -\n0.00 $0.10 $ -\nplus sales tax $ -\nLABOR ESTIMATE Hours \n(to .25 hour) Staff Rate1 Cost % of Total \nHours\nAdjusted \nHours Cost\n_______ Bureau Staff 0.00 0% 0.00 $ -\nAttorney General Staff 0.75 $44.00 33.00 13% 0.49 $ 21.52\nAdministrative Staff 3.00 $24.00 72.00 52% 1.96 $ 46.96\n0.00 0% 0.00 $ -\nArea 0.00 0% 0.00 $ -\n0.00 0% 0.00 $ -\n0.00 0% 0.00 $ -\nIT Staff Set-up Fee\n1 Hour for Each \nElectronic Search 2.00 $36.00 72.00 35% 1.30 $ 46.96\n5.75 $177.00 3.75 $ 115.43\nKeywords\nStations/\nServers \nto search\nHours per \nKeyword Staff Rate1 Cost (See \nInstructions)\nTotal \nHours\n% of Total \nHours\nAdjusted \nHours Cost\nBureau 0.125 $ - 0.00 0% 0.00 $ -\nArea 0.125 $ - 0.00 0% 0.00 $ -\nBureau 0.125 $23.00 $ - 0.00 0% 0.00 $ -\nArea 0.125 $ - 0.00 0% 0.00 $ -\nBureau 0.125 $ - 0.00 0% 0.00 $ -\nArea 0.125 $ - 0.00 0% 0.00 $ -\n0 0 0 $ - 0.00 0.00 $ -\nTotal Hours 5.75\nTotal Hours minus 2 3.75\nTotal Copies -\nSubtotal $177.00\nTotal (minus up to 100 copies & 2 hrs. labor2) $115.43\nServer\n@fusion.law Nov. 1 2023 - April 8, 2024\n@republicanags.com\n@ruleoflawdefensefund.org\n@rldf.org\n@uschamber.com\n@ipaa.org\n@energeoalliance.org\n@api.org\n@afpm.org\n@ierdc.org\n@axpc.org\n@aga.org\n@americanchemistry.com\n@ingaa.org\n@nullnoia.org\n@uschamber.com\n@eei.org\n@consumerenergyalliance.org\n@ngsa.org\n@convenience.org\n@nam.org\nWorkstation\nEmail Address \n@idl.idaho.gov Key Words\nJames Thum\nDustin Miller\n2024-0213\nNote: Fill in due date once fees received.
