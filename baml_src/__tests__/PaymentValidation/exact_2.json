For example, any correspondence relating to identifiable \nUniversity students are protected by the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act and are exempt \nfrom disclosure under KSA 45-221(a)(1). The records you requested may also be exempt from \ndisclosure under other exemptions including but not limited to K.S.A. 45-221(a)(14), and/or (30).\nI wanted to make you aware of these potential exemptions, as you are responsible for the expenses \nrequired to process your request regardless of whether any records are provided, redacted or \notherwise. You are responsible for pre-paying all estimated costs before we begin processing your \nrequest.\nWe anticipate the records responding to your request, such that they are available, will take a \nminimum of two hours of IT processing time, at $31.50 an hour. In addition, there would be an \nestimated one hour of Confidentiality/Privilege/Redaction review at $50.00 per hour. If you would \nlike the University to proceed with your request, please remit a check or money order made out to \nthe Kansas State University General Fund in the amount of $112.00, to my attention at the address \nbelow.\nYou will only pay the actual amount of expenses, whether that number is more or less than the \nestimate. You will receive a refund if the actual cost is less than the estimate. If the actual cost \nexceeds the estimate, you will be required to pay the difference before any responsive records are \nprovided.\nBest regards,\nHanna L.
