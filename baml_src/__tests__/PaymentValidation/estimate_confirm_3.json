Therefore, we provided you with a cost estimate as required by Section 552.2615 of the Texas Government Code. We did not receive your payment for this deposit until 4/2/2024 and began receiving responsive information at that point.\r\n\r\nUpon gathering requested information, it has become evident that that the estimated charges will exceed the charges detailed in the written itemized statement by 20 percent or more. Therefore, we are providing a written updated itemized statement that details all estimated charges that would be imposed, including any allowable charges for labor or personnel costs.\r\n\r\nItemized List of Charges:\r\nDescription                                      Qty x Price                        Total\r\nLabor minutes ($15/hour)            150,000 x $0.25               $37,500\r\nOverhead charges                          20% of $37,500                $7,500\r\n                                                          Total cost                          $45,000 (minus $900 of initial deposit received)\r\n\r\nThere is a less expensive way for you to obtain this information. You may view the information in person at our offices. If you choose to view the information in person, please provide me with three dates and times when it will be convenient for you to come.\r\n\r\nThe estimated charges exceed $100.00; therefore, as allowed by section 552.263(a) of the Government Code, we require a deposit of 100% ($44,100.00) before starting work on your request. Complying with this request require labor to locate, compile, and manipulate the requested information (as the requested information would require redactions to be made to remove the presence of confidential information not subject to disclosure under the Act).\r\n\r\nYour request will be considered automatically withdrawn if you do not notify us in writing within ten business days from the date of this letter that you either:\r\n\r\n     (a) accept the charges;\r\n     (b) wish to modify your request; OR\r\n     (c) have sent to the Open Records Division of the Office of the Attorney General a complaint alleging that you are being overcharged for the information you have requested.\r\n\r\nAll communications concerning this request should be identified with the above reference number and addressed to this mailbox or the address listed below. If you have any questions regarding your records request, please feel free to contact our office at this email address or (512) 782-5443.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nOpen Records\r\nTexas Military Department\r\nOffice: 512.782.5443\r\nFax: 737.358.9003\r\nP.O. Box 5218 (ATTN: FOIA)\r\nAustin, TX 78763\r\nng.tx.txarng.mbx.freedom-of-information-act@army.mil<mailto:ng.tx.txarng.mbx.freedom-of-information-act@army.mil>\n"
