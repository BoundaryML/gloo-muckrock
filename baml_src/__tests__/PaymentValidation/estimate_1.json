  "input": "Good afternoon,\n\n\n\nThe Owasso Police Department switched to a new records management system in September 2023 and all internal affairs files in the old records management system were expunged at that time. The records were not archived because the collective bargaining agreement between the City of Owasso and the Fraternal Order of Police requires that internal affairs records be expunged at different intervals. If the records would have been permanently archived, there would have been no way to expunge the records as required by the collective bargaining agreement. Therefore, the Professional Standards Division does not have internal affairs records for the years 2017-2022.\n\nIn accordance with the collective bargaining agreement, unless there is a tort or pending litigation, the Professional Standards Division must expunge its internal investigation files according to the following schedule:\n\n\n\n  1.  Written reprimands and notice of documented verbal counseling with no recurrence are expunged after eighteen (18) months from the date of discipline.\n\n  2.  Suspensions with no recurrence are expunged after three (3) years from the date of discipline.\n\n  3.  Unfounded, exonerated, not sustained, and no finding complaints may be maintained for no more than two (2) years from the date of the alleged occurrence.\n\nHowever, as previously mentioned, the Professional Standards Division expunged all of its internal affairs files in 2023 when the Owasso Police Department switched to a new records management system; therefore, the Professional Standards Division does not have individualized data or aggregate statistics for the requested items. There may be disciplinary records that are kept in employees’ master personnel files in the Human Resources Department, but those files are not maintained by the Police Department. Furthermore, at the sole discretion of the public body, a public body may keep personnel records confidential which relate to internal personnel investigations including examination and selection material for employment, hiring, appointment, promotion, demotion, discipline, or resignation unless such records pertain to final disciplinary action resulting in loss of pay, suspension, demotion of position, or termination (51 O.S. § 24A.7).\n\nIn reference to the request for use of force records, the Police Department does not maintain a database that is specific to use of force. Officers document use of force in the narrative of their reports. Therefore, a search for the requested use of force data would require staff from the Records Section to search each individual report that was completed during the specified time period to collect the data. The Professional Standards Division does not keep use of force data unless it is associated with an internal investigation.\n\nThere are over 19,000 cases from 2017-2022 that will need to be hand reviewed to determine if use of force was involved. This will require an extensive amount of research time with a charge of $15 an hour. This will be over the course of several weeks, it will not be a quick turnaround.\n\nIf you wish to proceed with your request or have any questions, please let us know.\n\n\n\nHave a wonderful day,\n\n\n\n\n\nMaddie Salfrank\n\nOwasso Police Records\n\n(918)376-1568\n\nMsalfrank@cityofowasso.com<mailto:Msalfrank@cityofowasso.com>\n\n\n\nDepartment Hours\n\nMonday-Thursday 7:30-5:30\n\nFriday 7:30-11:30\n\n\n\n“Your focus determines your reality”\n-Qui Gon Jinn"
