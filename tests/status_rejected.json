Y.10013\n(212) 335-9000\nMay 24, 2023\n[VIA EMAIL: 144 729-70387279@requests.muckrock.com]\nCaroline Haskins\nBusiness Insider\nRe: FOIL Request Dated April 19, 2023\nTo Caroline Haskins:\nThe New York County District Attorney's Office has received your Freedom\nof Information Law (\"FOIL\") request seeking records of e-mailed threats to this\nOffice or its employees from March 17, 2003 to the present with regard to the\nongoing criminal case against Donald Trump, and communications with other law\nenforcement agencies regarding coordinating security for this Office in light of such\nthreats. Although you reference the fact that this Office has publicly acknowledged\nthat it has received numerous threats since March 17, 2023, we have not released\ncopies of the actual threats themselves. Your FOIL request is therefore denied for\nthe following reasons:\nFirst, your request is denied on the ground that disclosure of the records you\nseek would pose a risk to the safety of the staff at this office as well as members of\nthe general public who visit this office. Public Officers Law (\"POL\")\u00c2\u00a7 87(2)(\u00c2\u00a3)\nexempts from disclosure records that, \"if disclosed, could endanger the life or safety\nof any person.\" POL \u00c2\u00a7 87 (2)(\u00c2\u00a3); In re Digital Forensics Unit v. New York City Police\nDepartment, 2023 N.Y. App. Div. LEXIS 1506 *2; 2023 N.Y. Slip Op. 01476 (1st\nDept. 2023); Matter of Bellamy v. New York Czry Police Department, 87 A.D.3d 874,875\n(1st Dept. 2011); Matter of Prisoners' Legal Servs. OJNY v. New York State Dept. of Corr.\n& Community Supervision, 209 A.D.3d 1208, 1211-12 (3d Dept. 2022). Public disclosure\nof the communications between this Office and other law enforcement agencies\nregarding the response to threats made to this Office and its employees-as well as\ncopies of the threats themselves-would provide any persons who represent a danger\nto this Office with a blueprint as to how to avoid whatever security systems are put in\nplace for the protection of this Office, its staff and members of the public. Disclosure\nof these records could also identify confidential sources of information regarding\nthreats to this office, which puts those individuals at risk of retaliation and/ or could\n\ndiscourage other such informants from coming forward in the future. 1 Matter of\nJohnson v. New York Ciry Police Dept., 257 A.D.2d 343, 349 (1st Dept. 1999).\nIn addition, your request is denied on the ground that the release of the\nrequested records may interfere with law enforcement investigation into the threats\nconveyed in those records. POL\u00c2\u00a7 87(2)(e)(i) exempts from disclosure records\ncompiled for law enforcement purposes and which, if disclosed, would interfere with\nan active criminal investigation, as well as with any further investigation and judicial\nproceedings that might be necessary. POL\u00c2\u00a7 87(2)(e)(i). See Whitley v. New York Counry\nDist. Atry. 's Office, 101 A.D.3d 455, 455 (1st Dept. 2012); Moreno v. New York Counry\nDistrict Attorney's Office, 38 A.D.3d 358, 358 (1st Dept. 2007); Matter of Legal Aid Sociery\nv NYPD, 274 A.D.2d 207,214 (1st Dept. 2000); Matter of Philip v. NYPD, 2014 N.Y.\nSlip Op 30408(U)(Sup. Ct. N.Y. County 2014).\nLastly, your request is denied because POL\u00c2\u00a7 87(2)(e)(iv) exempts from\ndisclosure records that would \"reveal criminal investigative techniques or procedures,\nexcept routine techniques and procedures.\" POL\u00c2\u00a7 87(2)(e)(iv). Such information is\nprotected when \"disclosure of those procedures would give rise to a substantial\nlikelihood that violators could evade detection by deliberately tailoring their conduct\nin anticipation of avenues of inquiry to be pursued by agency personnel.\" Fink v.\nLefkowit~ 47 N.Y.2d 567, 572 (1979); see also Matter of Bellamy v. New York Ciry Police\nDept., 59 A.D.3d 353 (Sup. Ct., N.Y. County 2009).\nThe Freedom of Information Law Appeals Officer is Assistant District\nAttorney Robin McCabe, Chief of the Civil Litigation Unit, Office of the General\nCounsel, at the above address.\nMadeleine Guilmain\nAssistant District Attorney\nRecords Access Officer\n1 Moreover, records containing identifying information of possible informants are also protected\nfrom disclosure under the privacy exemption.
