    "file_text": "Below was a text message sent to the Castro CBD on 4/28/23\nApril 24, 2023 Dear Supervisors Mandelman, Melgar, Peskin and Preston,\nAt the recent hearing of the Land Use & Transportation Committee, much commentary focused \non an anonymous petition purporting to represent over 100 members of the Castro Merchants \nAssociation and other businesses in our neighborhood. It was represented that this hastily \nassembled petition showed neighboring merchants were in favor of APE\\'s plans for the \nrenovation and remodeling of the Castro Theatre. We do not question that some of our \nmembers want the Castro Theatre to fully reopen and support APE\\'s plans unconditionally, but I\nam writing on behalf of the Castro Merchants to question the veracity of this petition and ask \nthat you please disregard it until we have ample opportunity to investigate it further.\nAs you can see from the email below, Wells Fargo has not signed onto the petition as claimed in \nthe attached testimony. We question whether other national corporations listed, such as Whole \nFoods, Pet Food Supply (sic) and FedEx are signers as well.\nA number of signers are duplicates, with multiple signatures from one business.\nMany signatures are from front counter staff, not business owners.\nSignatories, some with limited English, have reported that they did not know what they were \nsigning.\nThe whole petition is presented anonymously with no logo or letterhead, and we have heard \nreports that petition circulators represented to shopkeepers that the petition was sponsored by \nCastro Merchants as indicated in testimony. This is false.\nThe premise of the petition is disingenuous at best. In fact, it is very likely that all the board \nmembers of the Castro Merchants and very likely all the members of the Save the Castro \nCoalition would sign the petition as well as written - but it says nothing about the removal of \nthe permanent seating and leveling of the floor, or about the 180 dark days proposed by APE, \nthe ADA concerns, the LGBTQ cultural displacement issues, etc. The petition is misleading on its \nface.\nThe petition did not come from the merchants. It was coordinated by APE with the Castro CBD, \nwhich represents the building owners, not the small businesses of the neighborhood.\nThe petition was circulated by the Castro CBD to our members without our knowledge. APE has \ndivided the community with this kind of clumsy tactic for months, and it saddens us to hear it \nrepresented as worthy of consideration by the Supervisors. \nWe ask that you disregard this fraudulent petition. We will keep you informed as we continue \nour investigation into its veracity.\nIn the meantime, Castro Merchants stands by its statement, endorsed by our membership. We \nwill support APE\\'s plans for the Castro Theatre once Supervisor Mandelman confirms that APE \n(1) has provided an adequate independent economic report showing the positive effects of the \nbusiness plans for the neighboring merchants, and (2) continues to participate in good faith \nnegotiations with the community.\nThank you for your attention to this matter,\n\nTerry Beswick, Treasurer\nCastro Merchants",
