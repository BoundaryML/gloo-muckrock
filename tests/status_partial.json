I am not able to provide all documents by the originally estimated date of June 8, 2023.\n\n\n\nThe new completion estimate is now September 20, 2023. I will do my best to complete this request as quickly as possible. I anticipate at least 2-3 installments remain.\n\nThe next installment will be provided by June 28, 2023.\n\nThe district uses SharePoint to deliver response documents.\nYour documents are stored in a SharePoint folder.  I have just shared that folder with you.\n\nYou will receive an email directly from SharePoint to the folder with your files.\nYou will then go through a short process to get an access code from SharePoint.

    "communication": "Dear Ms. Barghouty & Ms. Pickoff-White:  \nAs you know, this office serves as City Attorneys for the City of Clovis (\u201cCity\u201d).  We are in receipt of your Public Records Act (\u201cPRA\u201d) request dated January 23, 2023.  Your request states that it seeks records pursuant to Senate Bills 1421 and 16 for police officer records under the categories identified by Penal Code section 832.7, subdivision (b), for the time period of January 1, 2014, to January 23, 2023.    \n\nOn March 17, 2023, the City provided you with \u201cBatch 1\u201d containing responsive, non-exempt documents.  On March 22, 2023, the City provided you with \u201cBatch 2\u201d containing additional responsive, non-exempt documents.  We informed you in our prior correspondence dated April 14, 2023, that the City would make all reasonable efforts to provide further responsive, non-exempt documents to you on a rolling basis in a manner consistent with the PRA by no later than May 19, 2023, provided that we would timely notify you if this was not possible.    \n\nAccordingly, enclosed with the transmission of this correspondence, the City is providing you with further responsive, non-exempt, documents.  This additional set of documents will be referred to as \u201cBatch 3.\u201d  Please note that the City will not disclose information such as personal data, including home addresses or telephone numbers, to preserve the anonymity of family members, whistleblowers, complainants, victims, and witnesses.  (Pen. Code \u00a7 832.7, subd. (b)(6).)  Additionally, the City will not release any records which contain sensitive and private information that would constitute an unwarranted invasion of privacy and, therefore, the public interest served by not disclosing the records clearly outweighs the public interest served by disclosure.  (Pen. Code, \u00a7 832.7, subd. (b)(7); Gov. Code. \u00a7 7922.000.)  Accordingly, such information has been redacted from the documents produced.  Deputy City Attorney Matthew M. Lear is the party responsible for asserting the exemptions.        \n\nDue to the volume of the remaining documents, the City is still in the process of preparing the raw audio/video footage for production.  The City will continue to produce these records on a rolling basis and will make all reasonable efforts to provide the requested records to you in a manner consistent with the PRA.  The City anticipates that it will be able to provide some, if not all, of these remaining documents by no later than June 16, 2023, provided that we will timely notify you if this is not possible.    \n\nWe thank you for your continued courtesy.
