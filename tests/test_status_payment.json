The \ninformation I am looking for is nonpersonal ([i.e.,] [n]ame, campus address and \ntelephone number, title, rate of pay, job description and date of hire). We would like \ndisaggregated figures, not aggregated. To assist in this process, I have listed with \nmore specificity, the information we are looking for:\nNon Personal records:\n\u00e2\u0080\u00a2 Name (first and last)[;]\n\u00e2\u0080\u00a2 Email[;]\n\u00e2\u0080\u00a2 Title[;]\n\u00e2\u0080\u00a2 Rate of pay (base pay, other pay, overtime pay, benefits, and total pay)[;]\n\u00e2\u0080\u00a2 Job description[;]\n\u00e2\u0080\u00a2 Date of hire[;]\n\u00e2\u0080\u00a2 If the institution has a system of categorizing employees[,] please include their \ncategorization and corresponding codebook if relevant[;]\n\u00e2\u0080\u00a2 Department and/or Area and/or Office[.]\nPursuant to MCL 15.235(2), I am writing to inform you that your request will be granted in \npart and denied in part. Pursuant to MCL 15.235(5), please allow this correspondence to serve to \ninform you that the portions of your request which have been denied are as follows:\nCertain records from the period you requested do not exist within the College\u00e2\u0080\u0099s \npossession, custody or control, and cannot be provided because Grand Rapids \nCommunity College was part of the Grand Rapids Public School system (\u00e2\u0080\u009cGRPS\u00e2\u0080\u009d) until \n\n1991. While employment records for pre-1991 employees who continued with GRCC \nare within the College\u00e2\u0080\u0099s possession and control, records of employees who separated \nbefore 1991 would be within the exclusive possession and control of GRPS. \nAs set forth further below, the College will begin to fulfill the portions of your request which \nhave been granted upon receipt of a good-faith deposit which does not exceed fifty percent \n(50%) of the College\u00e2\u0080\u0099s fee calculation regarding this request.\nThe FOIA provides that a public body may charge a fee for the search, retrieval, examination, review, \nand separation and deletion of exempt from nonexempt material, where the failure to do so would \nresult in unreasonably high costs to the public body because of the nature of the request in the \nparticular instance and where the public body specifically identifies the nature of these \nunreasonably high costs. See MCL 15.234(1), (3). \nIn this instance, fulfilling your request for the employment records of each employee who has \nworked for GRCC for a period of thirty-eight (38) years (including annual compensation and benefit \ninformation; contact information; and job descriptions) would result in an unreasonably high cost \nto the College. The process involved with providing the records you have requested will include \nsearching for, retrieving, and examining voluminous employment records maintained and stored in \nhard-copy formats, and in no less than three (3) electronic enterprise management systems. \nAdditionally, voluminous records currently in hard-copy formats will need to be duplicated or \npublished in electronic or digital formats in order to be made available. Finally, all of the \nvoluminous records the College anticipates would be responsive to your request will need to be \nreviewed by College employee(s) to ensure the separation of exempt material from nonexempt \nmaterial.\nIf, as here, GRCC estimates a fee to process a FOIA request will be greater than $50.00, the College \nwill require a good-faith deposit from the requester before providing the public records to the \nrequester. See MCL 15.234(8). Pursuant to the FOIA, the deposit request shall not exceed one-half \n(1/2) of the total estimated fee, and any written notice must provide a best-efforts estimate by GRCC \nregarding the time frame after the deposit is received that it will take GRCC to provide the public \nrecords to the requestor. Id.\nIn this instance, GRCC has reviewed your request and has determined that the estimated cost \nto comply with fulfilling your entire request would be $82,702.80. The following is a \nbreakdown regarding how this cost was determined:\n\nLabor:\nSearching for, locating, and examining the material:\nNo. of Hours: 1,280 hours\nWage Rate1: $30.66 per hour \nFringe Multiplier2: 1.50\n1,280 hours x $30.66 per hour x 1.50 fringe multiplier = $58,867.20\nReviewing the material, including separating exempt from non-exempt \nmaterial:\nNo. of Hours: 320 hours\nWage Rate: $30.66 per hour \nFringe Multiplier: 1.50\n320 hours x $30.66 per hour x 1.50 fringe multiplier = $14,716.80\nDuplication or publication (including making digital copies or transferring \npublic records to digital or electronic formats):\nNo. of Hours: 240 hours\nWage Rate $25.33 per hour \nFringe Multiplier: 1.50\n240 hours x $25.33 per hours x 1.50 fringe multiplier = $9,118.80\nPostage: No fee.\nNon-Paper Physical Media: No fee.\n________________________________________\n1 All wage rates in the itemized fee calculation are based on the rate for the lowest-paid College \nemployee who is capable of performing this work.\n2 A public body may add up to fifty percent (50%) of the applicable labor charge amount to \ncover or partially cover the cost of fringe benefits.\n\nPursuant to MCL 15.234(8), GRCC is requesting a good-faith deposit in the amount of \n$41,000.00 before providing the public records you requested. The deposit fee may be made \npayable to \u00e2\u0080\u009cGrand Rapids Community College\u00e2\u0080\u009d and may be sent to the following address:\nAttn: FOIA Coordinator\nGrand Rapids Community College\n143 Bostwick Ave NE\nGrand Rapids, MI 49503\nIf the requested deposit is not received by GRCC within forty-five (45) days of the date of your \nreceipt of this correspondence, and if you have not filed an appeal regarding the deposit amount, \nyour request will be considered abandoned pursuant to MCL 15.234(14).\nGRCC estimates that, upon receipt of the deposit, it will require approximately one hundred \nand fifty (150) business days to provide you with the public records you have requested.\nThis correspondence will confirm that, with respect to the College\u00e2\u0080\u0099s fee and deposit request, you \nhave the right to do the following under the FOIA:\n1. Within forty-five (45) days, submit to the President of Grand Rapids Community College a \nwritten appeal that specifically states the word \u00e2\u0080\u009cappeal\u00e2\u0080\u009d and identifies the reason or reasons \nwhy the required fee identified in this correspondence exceeds the amount permitted under \nGRCC\u00e2\u0080\u0099s available procedures and guidelines or Section 4 (MCL 15.234) of the FOIA.\n2. Within forty-five (45) days of receiving a determination of an appeal to the President of \nGrand Rapids Community College, commence an action for a fee reduction in an appropriate \ncourt.\nYou may have the right to receive attorney\u00e2\u0080\u0099s fees and damages if, after judicial review, a court \ndetermines that Grand Rapids Community College has not complied with the requirements of the \nFOIA with respect to its fee calculation.\nFinally, pursuant to the FOIA please allow this correspondence to confirm that, with respect to the \nCollege\u00e2\u0080\u0099s partial denial of your request, you have the right to do either of the following:\n1. Within 180 days, submit to the President of Grand Rapids Community College a written \nappeal that specifically states the word \u00e2\u0080\u009cappeal\u00e2\u0080\u009d and identifies the reason or reasons for \nreversal of any denial of your request; or\n2. Within 180 days, commence an action in an appropriate court to compel disclosure of any \npublic records request that was denied.\n\nYou have the right to receive attorney\u00e2\u0080\u0099s fees and damages if, after judicial review, a court determines \nthat Grand Rapids Community College has not complied with the requirements of the FOIA and \norders disclosure of all or a portion of the requested public record(s).

Your \nrequest was received by the City of Detroit Freedom of Information Act Section, via email, on March 6, 2023. \nBecause your request was received by electronic transmission, pursuant to Section 5(1) of the Michigan \nFreedom of Information Act (the \u00e2\u0080\u009cAct\u00e2\u0080\u009d), MCL 15.235(1); your request is deemed to have been received at the \nLaw Department on the next business day, March 7, 2023. In accordance with Section 5(2)(d) of the Act, MCL \n15.235(2)(d), we sent a letter extending our time to respond until March 28, 2023. The City provided its initial \nresponse on March 29, 2023. Thank you for your patience.\nYour letter requests:\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAll police incident reports /investigative reports connected to any use of \nforce incident by officers in your department between January 1, 2020 and \nDecember 31, 2022.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\nThe record from the Detroit Police Department (DPD) which corresponds to your request, consists of four \nthousand and nineteen (4019) pages. DPD Office of Internal Affairs indicated that it took 25 hours at a rate of \n$35.97 per hour to comply with your request. In addition, City of Detroit Law Department personnel must \nconduct a line-by-line review of the record in order to separate the exempt from non-exempt information before \nreleasing the record. A conservative estimate of sixty-five (65) hours is needed to perform the necessary review \nand redactions by the Law Department personnel. The hourly rate of the lowest paid Law Department personnel \nwho is capable of such a review and redaction is $33.60 per hour. Therefore, the City will incur an adjusted \nestimated labor cost in the amount of Three Thousand Nine Hundred and Twenty-Nine 86/100 Dollars \n($3,929.86) [25 hours x $35.97/hr plus 65 hours x $33.60/hr plus fringe benefits reduced by 5% due to delay in \nresponse] in order to comply with your request. Please see attached updated FOIA Fee Estimate form.\nAccordingly, pursuant to MCL 15.234(8), we require that you provide a deposit in the amount of One\nThousand Nine Hundred and Sixty-Four 93/100 Dollars ($1,964.93) [$3,929.86 divided by 2]. However, we \nare in receipt of a prior deposit in the amount of $916.64. Therefore, the balance of the deposit owed is\n$1,048.29 [$1,964.93-$916.64]. Please submit said amount in the form of a money order or check made payable \nto the \"City of Detroit\". Also, let me know by June 21, 2023 as to how you wish to proceed in this matter. \nAdditionally, include the FOIA request number listed above on the memo line of your check/money order \nor on a separate note and forward to my attention. It is important to note that we do not accept cash. Please \ndo not write on the check outside of the memo line as our bank will not process checks with writing \noutside of the memo line.
