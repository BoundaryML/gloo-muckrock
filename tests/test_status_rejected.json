Shinseki Federal Court Case(s) and its related \nAction(s), that were entered into by and between the \nPlaintiff(s) and Defendant(s) in that Case; wherever such \nAgreement(s) to any of the aforementioned Case(s) and \nAction(s) exist, if any.\nYou provided background regarding your request, including that \u00e2\u0080\u009cValentini v. Shinseki \nis a Civil Rights Case filed in the Federal Court for the Central District of California in \n2011 under Case Number 2:11-cv-04846\u00e2\u0080\u009d and that VA is one of the Defendants in the \ncase. You claimed that there is no settlement agreement entered or \u00e2\u0080\u009c[n]oticed to the \nValentini Court and / or Entered upon it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Docket(s)\u00e2\u0080\u009d despite a \u00e2\u0080\u009cFinal Judgment Order of \nFebruary 17th, 2015 in That Case expressly Orders \u00e2\u0080\u0098Should this matter fail to resolve \nitself, the Court shall reinstate all previously issued order.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\u00e2\u0080\u009d \n\nFees VA\u00e2\u0080\u0099s FOIA regulations require each request to be characterized under 38 \nC.F.R. \u00c2\u00a7 1.561(c) and fees to be estimated and charged, when applicable. Your request \nwas characterized as a \u00e2\u0080\u009cNews Media\u00e2\u0080\u009d requester. You were not charged any fees for the \nprocessing of this request. \nSearch On January 6, 2022, OGC FOIA Officer Gregory Draves requested \nresponsive records from the Real Property Law Group (RPLG), which is the practice \ngroup within OGC that worked on the Valentini litigation. The RPLG attorney assigned \nto the litigation searched Outlook for the terms \u00e2\u0080\u009cValentini settlement\u00e2\u0080\u009d and \u00e2\u0080\u009cValentini v. \nShinseki.\u00e2\u0080\u009d The search produced a copy of the 2015 settlement agreement and a \nrestatement of the settlement agreement executed by the parties in 2017. The attorney \nalso noted that the 2015 agreement is publicly available at the following address: \nhttps://www.westladraftmasterplan.org/documentation/extra-info. \nInitial Agency Decision (IAD) On January 11, 2021, Mr. Draves issued an IAD, \nnotifying you that responsive records had been located. He identified two (2) \ndocuments, totaling seven (7) pages, as responsive to your request. He provided the \ntwo documents to you in their entirety. You were also provided with the appropriate \nappeal, mediation, and public liaison rights. \nResponsive Records The documents disclosed to you consisted of (1) \nRestatement of Settlement Agreement (dated January 12, 2017) \u00e2\u0080\u0093 four (4) pages; and \n(2) Principles for a Partnership and Framework for Settlement By and Between the U.S. \nDepartment of Veterans Affairs (dated January 28, 2015) \u00e2\u0080\u0093 three (3) pages. \nAppeal In a letter dated March 8, 2022, and received in our office on March 23, \n2022, you appealed the full grant IAD. You argued that the document dated January 28, \n2015, is not a settlement agreement because it \u00e2\u0080\u009cdoes not state nor stipulate anywhere \ntherein, that it is the very Settlement Agreement to any Federal Action whatsoever\u00e2\u0080\u009d and \nit is \u00e2\u0080\u009cexpressly not enforceable in any court, about various expectations, between \npersons who were not Plaintiffs in Valentini v. Shinseki\u00e2\u0080\u00a6\u00e2\u0080\u009d \nYou also questioned the responsiveness of the document dated January 12, \n2017. You wrote that it refers to an agreement signed on January 28, 2015, and you \nclaim that \u00e2\u0080\u009cno such referred-to agreement exists, unless it has never been Released to \nthe Public\u00e2\u0080\u00a6\u00e2\u0080\u009d You also write that even if it did exist, it is not a settlement agreement in \nValentini v. Shinseki because the plaintiffs in Valentini v. Shineski \u00e2\u0080\u009care not a private non\u00ef\u00bf\u00beprofit corporation named Vets Advocacy.\u00e2\u0080\u009d You also claim that neither of the two \nsignatories to the document, Ronald Olson and Ann Brown, are party to the Valentini v. \nShineski litigation. \nYou also claim that the two documents \u00e2\u0080\u009cdo not appear to be registered and \naccepted by the Valentini Court on the Federal Docket of that Action. In fact, the Case \nRecord Notices, well after January 15, 2015 \u00e2\u0080\u0093 that the actual parties to Valentini v. \nShinseki purportedly intended to stipulate to settle in the future.\u00e2\u0080\u009d You also stated that \u00e2\u0080\u009cit \n\nappears the Plaintiffs in the Action were never present in session after they Prevailed, \nas in Won the Case, in Fall of 2013.\u00e2\u0080\u009d \nRelevant Law We have thoroughly reviewed your appeal under the provisions of the \nFOIA, which provides that federal agencies must disclose records requested unless \nthey may be withheld in accordance with one or more of nine statutory exemptions. 5 \nU.S.C. \u00c2\u00a7 552(b).\nAnalysis You appear to question the adequacy of the records search and whether the \ndocuments provided to you are, in fact, the documents you requested. Mr. Draves \ncontacted an OGC attorney with first-hand knowledge of the Valentini litigation, who \nsearched for and located the two (2) settlement agreements. We believe the efforts \ntaken to locate the documents you seek were sufficient to satisfy the duty of the \nDepartment under the FOIA to conduct a reasonable search. \nFurthermore, we have examined both documents and the docket history for Case \nNo. 2:11-cv-04846 in the U.S. District Court for the Central District of California. Based \non our careful review, we conclude that the two (2) documents are responsive to, and \nfulfill, your request. We address each of your arguments, below, in turn.\nYou identify three (3) alleged issues with the January 28, 2015 (\u00e2\u0080\u009cJanuary 2015\u00e2\u0080\u009d) \ndocument. You state that it is not a settlement agreement because \u00e2\u0080\u009cit does not state or \nstipulate anywhere therein, that it is the very Settlement Agreement to any Federal \nAction whatsoever\u00e2\u0080\u00a6\u00e2\u0080\u009d Please note that the preamble of the document states that it is \nbetween the VA and representatives of the plaintiffs in the Valentini case. Paragraph 5 \nof the document also states that the parties will file a joint motion in the District Court \n\u00e2\u0080\u009cfor an indicative ruling that, in light of the parties\u00e2\u0080\u0099 commitment to work as partners, the \nDistrict court would vacate its judgment in Valentini v. McDonald . . . and coordinate to \nfile additional pleadings . . . as well as pleadings necessary to effect a dismissal without \nprejudice of the entire action\u00e2\u0080\u00a6\u00e2\u0080\u009d That the January 2015 document does not contain your \npreferred specific wording does not mean it is not a settlement agreement. You also \ntake issue with the fact that Paragraph 14 of the document states that it is \u00e2\u0080\u009cnot intended \nto be enforceable in any court\u00e2\u0080\u00a6\u00e2\u0080\u009d We note that lack of enforceability in court does not \nnegate the fact that the January 2015 document is a settlement agreement, which \nultimately resulted in the case being dismissed. Finally, you argue that the January 2015 \ndocument is \u00e2\u0080\u009cbetween persons who were not Plaintiffs\u00e2\u0080\u009d in the litigation. Please note that \nattorney Ronald Olson signed the agreement \u00e2\u0080\u009con behalf of all plaintiffs\u00e2\u0080\u009d and, as such, it \nwas not necessary for each individual plaintiff to sign.\nWe further direct your attention to the docket for Case No. 2:11-cv-04846 in the \nU.S. District Court for the Central District of California. As discussed in the January \n2015 document, Electronic Court Filing (ECF) 188 is a Notice of Motion and Joint Motion \nfor Order for Indicative Ruling Pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 62.1. The document states: \n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThe Plaintiffs and Government Defendants (the \u00e2\u0080\u0098moving parties\u00e2\u0080\u0099) have recently reached \nagreement to work together in partnership to address these important challenges rather \n\nthan continue this litigation.\u00e2\u0080\u009d ECF 196 is a Joint Stipulation to Dismiss Case, which \nstates: \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe parties further stipulate that this dismissal shall be without prejudice, and \nthat each party shall bear its own costs. The reasons for this dismissal have been set \nforth previously in the Joint Motion To Vacate Judgment Pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. \n60(b), ECF 193, as well as in the Joint Motion for Indicative Ruling Pursuant to Fed. R. \nCiv. P. 62.1, ECF 188, and have been addressed in the Court\u00e2\u0080\u0099s orders granting the \nabove-referenced motions. See Order, February 17, 2015, ECF 194; Order, February \n3, 2015, ECF 189.\u00e2\u0080\u009d If you have further questions regarding the January 2015 settlement \nagreement and the conclusion of the litigation, we suggest you review the \naforementioned court filings. \nYou also identified three (3) alleged issues with the January 12, 2017 (\u00e2\u0080\u009cJanuary\n2017\u00e2\u0080\u009d) document. You wrote that the January 2017 document references an agreement \nsigned on January 28, 2015, that does not exist, unless it has never been publicly \nreleased. The referenced January 28, 2015, document is the previously discussed\nJanuary 2015 settlement agreement that was disclosed to you. You also suggest that \nthe January 2017 document is not a settlement in the Valentini case because the \nplaintiffs in Valentini \u00e2\u0080\u009care not a private non-profit corporation named Vets Advocacy.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\nPer the January 2015 settlement, the Plaintiffs\u00e2\u0080\u0099 representatives formed a non-profit \ncorporation \u00e2\u0080\u009cto help meet the objective and goals\u00e2\u0080\u009d of the January 2015 settlement. That \nnon-profit is Vets Advocacy. You also claim that neither of the two (2) signatories to the \ndocument, Mr. Ronald Olson and Ms. Ann Brown, are party to the Valentini litigation.\nMr. Olson, who signed the January 2015 agreement on behalf of all plaintiffs, signed \nthe January 2017 agreement as a representative of Vets Advocacy, where he serves \non the Board of Directors. Ms. Brown signed the agreement in her capacity as the VA \nMedical Center Director, on behalf of the VA, who was a party to the litigation. \nWe would also like to direct your attention to publicly available information \nregarding the settlement and the Valentini litigation. As the RPLG attorney noted, \nsettlement information is available on the VA Greater Los Angeles Healthcare System \nDraft Master Plan website. See https://www.westladraftmasterplan.org/. On the \u00e2\u0080\u009cAbout\u00e2\u0080\u009d \npage, the timeline includes a link to the Valentini v. McDonald settlement in the \u00e2\u0080\u009c1st\nQuarter 2015.\u00e2\u0080\u009d See https://www.westladraftmasterplan.org/about. The site describes \nthe settlement as follows: \u00e2\u0080\u009cOn January 28, 2015, former VA Secretary Robert McDonald \nsettled a class action lawsuit against the Department of Veterans Affairs alleging VA \nwas mismanaging the West LA Campus, by allowing commercial uses of land versus \nusing the land to support and care for our nation\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Veterans. VA and representatives of \nthe plaintiffs pledged to work together as partners to end veteran homelessness in the \nGreater Los Angeles area.\u00e2\u0080\u009d On the \u00e2\u0080\u009cLibrary\u00e2\u0080\u009d page, under \u00e2\u0080\u009cSource & Update Documents\u00e2\u0080\u009d \nand then \u00e2\u0080\u009cBackground Information,\u00e2\u0080\u009d there are links to both \u00e2\u0080\u009cSettlement Agreement \u00e2\u0080\u0093\n2015\u00e2\u0080\u009d and \u00e2\u0080\u009cRestatement of Settlement Agreement \u00e2\u0080\u0093 2017\u00e2\u0080\u009d for download. See\nhttps://www.westladraftmasterplan.org/documentation/extra-info. They are the same \ndocuments that were disclosed to you.\n\nAdditionally, the Vets Advocacy website states that it is a \u00e2\u0080\u009cnon-profit organization \nfacilitating revitalization of the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs West Los Angeles \ncampus as a condition of the Valentini v. Shinseki settlement.\u00e2\u0080\u009d See\nhttps://www.vatherightway.org/vets-advocacy/. On that same website, when you click \non \u00e2\u0080\u009cSettlement Agreement\u00e2\u0080\u009d on the timeline for January 2015, the following description \nappears: \u00e2\u0080\u009cVA Secretary Bob McDonald and Plaintiff Partners sign the \u00e2\u0080\u0098Principles for \nPartnership and Framework for Settlement\u00e2\u0080\u0099 agreement which called for the creation of \na veterans homelessness strategy, mutual cooperation in the development of a Master \nPlan to set out the most effective use of the campus for veterans, development of an \nexit strategy for leases not pertaining to veteran healthcare or housing and the creation \nof a non-profit entity (Vets Advocacy) to assist in such efforts. Both parties also agreed \nto file a joint motion to the District Court that would vacate its judgment in Valentini v. \nMcDonald.\u00e2\u0080\u009d A link to the January 28, 2015, document is also available. \nConclusion Based upon the foregoing, your appeal is denied.\nMediation and Appeal Rights This final agency decision concludes the \nadministrative processing of your appeal.\nAs part of the 2007 FOIA amendments, the Office of Government Information \nServices (OGIS) was created to offer mediation services.
