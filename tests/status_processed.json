DEQ has received your request for the following records: \n\n\\\"To Whom It May Concern:\n\nPursuant to the Montana Freedom of Information Act, I hereby request the following records:\n\nWe are aware that air quality management agencies sometimes conduct \\\"exceptional event demonstrations,\\\" which are analyses to demonstrate that emissions from potential exceptional events caused an exceedance of one or more NAAQS. These demonstrations are then submitted to the Regional EPA office in order to request that the office exclude the air quality monitoring data from use in certain regulatory determinations.\n\nConcerning services related to these exceptional event analyses, we request:\n1. Any and all executed contracts, memorandums of understanding (MOUs), or other equivalent agreements that are currently active, or have been active within the last five years;\n2. Any addenda, amendments, attachments, exhibits, materials, and schedules;\n3. Any and all correspondence, between the relevant air quality agency and the contracting individual, corporation, or other entity, related to the implementation of these agreements.\n\nThe requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.\n\nIn the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not.\n\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 10 business days.\n\nSincerely,\n\nDillon Bergin\\\" \n\nDEQ is presently evaluating your request in order to provide a cost estimation, if requested, or to fulfill the request.

    "communication": "Dear Matthew,\nPer your request of May 22, 2023, I have updated your FOIA request, FOIA\ntracking number *RD 77093*, to reflect that you narrowed your request to\nFBI case file *100-MI-15812 *(I have also removed FBI case\nfile 100A-BA-25222 from your request). Since your request does not exceed\n700 pages, I have reassigned it to our *first-tier processing queue*.\nTaking into consideration our existing backlog, we *estimate* it will take*\n39 months* to complete processing.\n\nRecords transferred to the custody of the National Archives are exempt from\nthe fee and fee waiver provisions of the Freedom of Information Act because\na fee schedule was in effect prior to enactment. The applicable section\nstates that \u201cnothing in this subparagraph shall supersede fees chargeable\nunder a statute specifically providing for setting the level of fees for\nparticular types of records\u201d (5 U.S.C. 552 (a)(4)(A)(vi)). The relevant fee\nstatute authorizes the National Archives \u201cto charge a fee for making or\nauthenticating copies or reproductions of materials transferred to the\nArchivist\u2019s custody.\u201d (44 U.S.C. 2116(c)). The inability to grant the\nrequested fee waiver does not constitute a denial under the terms of the\nFreedom of Information Act.\n\n\nIn the future, someone from our office will contact you to inform you that\na line-by-line review of the case file has been completed. At that point,\nyou will have the option to order a copy for a fee of 80 cents per page or\nview the record in-person.\n\n\nIf you visit the National Archives at College Park, Maryland, we will save\na digital surrogate of the original record (this will be the reviewed copy\nthat may include redactions) to a CD and you will be able to view the file*\nat no cost*. If you need to use one of our public access computers you will\nneed to bring a universal serial bus (USB) drive so that you will be able\nto download a copy. You also have the option of bringing your own personal\nlaptop that has a CD-Drive in order to copy the file(s) that way.\n\n\nSincerely,\n\nREBECCA SHARP\nArchivist\nSpecial Access and FOIA Program (RF)\nNational Archives and Records Administration\n\n8601 Adelphi Road\n\nCollege Park, MD 20740-6001\n\n(301) 837-0372\n\nrebecca.sharp@nara.gov\nwww.archives.gov/research/foia/",
