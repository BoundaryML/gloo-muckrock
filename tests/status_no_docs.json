Based on the \ninformation you provided, we conducted a main entity record search of the Central Records System (CRS)\nper our standard search policy. However, we were unable to identify records subject to the FOIPA that are \nresponsive to your request. Therefore, your request is being closed. If you have additional information \npertaining to the subject of your request, please submit a new request providing the details, and we will\nconduct an additional search. For more information about records searches and the standard search policy, \nsee the enclosed FBI FOIPA Addendum General Information Section.\nPlease see the paragraphs below for relevant information that may be specific to your request. \nOnly checked boxes contain corresponding paragraphs relevant to your request. If no boxes are checked, \nthe corresponding information does not apply.\nPlease be advised that your request was reopened based on the additional information you \nprovided. A new search was conducted, and we were unable to identify records subject to the \nFOIPA that are responsive to your request. \nRecords potentially responsive to your request were destroyed. Since this material could not be \nreviewed, it is not known if it was responsive to your request. Record retention and disposal is \ncarried out under supervision of the National Archives and Records Administration (NARA) \naccording to Title 44 United States Code Section 3301, Title 36 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) \nChapter 12 Sub-chapter B Part 1228, and 36 CFR 1229.10. Please be advised that the General \nRecords Schedule (GRS) disposition authority for FOIPA records is DAA-GRS-2016-0002-0001 \n(GRS 4.2, Item 020). \nRecords potentially responsive to your request were transferred to the National Archives and \nRecords Administration (NARA). If you wish to review these records, file a FOIPA request with \nNARA at the following address:\nNational Archives and Records Administration \nSpecial Access and FOIA\n8601 Adelphi Road, Room 5500\nCollege Park, MD 20740-6001\nPotentially responsive records were identified during the search. However, we were advised that \nthey were not in their expected locations. An additional search for the missing records also met \nwith unsuccessful results.

Part 1 of the Addendum includes standard responses that apply to all requests. \nPart 2 includes standard responses that apply to requests for records about individuals to the extent your request seeks the listed \ninformation. Part 3 includes general information about FBI records, searches, and programs. \nPart 1: The standard responses below apply to all requests:\n(i) 5 U.S.C. \u00c2\u00a7 552(c). Congress excluded three categories of law enforcement and national security records from the \nrequirements of the FOIPA [5 U.S.C. \u00c2\u00a7 552(c)]. FBI responses are limited to those records subject to the requirements of the \nFOIPA. Additional information about the FBI and the FOIPA can be found on the www.fbi.gov/foia website.\n(ii) Intelligence Records. To the extent your request seeks records of intelligence sources, methods, or activities, the FBI can \nneither confirm nor deny the existence of records pursuant to FOIA exemptions (b)(1), (b)(3), and as applicable to requests for \nrecords about individuals, PA exemption (j)(2) [5 U.S.C. \u00c2\u00a7\u00c2\u00a7 552/552a (b)(1), (b)(3), and (j)(2)]. The mere acknowledgment of \nthe existence or nonexistence of such records is itself a classified fact protected by FOIA exemption (b)(1) and/or would reveal \nintelligence sources, methods, or activities protected by exemption (b)(3) [50 USC \u00c2\u00a7 3024(i)(1)]. This is a standard response \nand should not be read to indicate that any such records do or do not exist.\nPart 2: The standard responses below apply to all requests for records on individuals: \n(i) Requests for Records about any Individual\u00e2\u0080\u0094Watch Lists. The FBI can neither confirm nor deny the existence of any \nindividual\u00e2\u0080\u0099s name on a watch list pursuant to FOIA exemption (b)(7)(E) and PA exemption (j)(2) [5 U.S.C. \u00c2\u00a7\u00c2\u00a7 552/552a \n(b)(7)(E), (j)(2)]. This is a standard response and should not be read to indicate that watch list records do or do not exist.\n(ii) Requests for Records about any Individual\u00e2\u0080\u0094Witness Security Program Records. The FBI can neither confirm nor deny \nthe existence of records which could identify any participant in the Witness Security Program pursuant to FOIA exemption \n(b)(3) and PA exemption (j)(2) [5 U.S.C. \u00c2\u00a7\u00c2\u00a7 552/552a (b)(3), 18 U.S.C. 3521, and (j)(2)]. This is a standard response and \nshould not be read to indicate that such records do or do not exist. \n(iii) Requests for Confidential Informant Records. The FBI can neither confirm nor deny the existence of confidential\ninformant records pursuant to FOIA exemptions (b)(7)(D), (b)(7)(E), and (b)(7)(F) [5 U.S.C.\u00c2\u00a7 \u00c2\u00a7 552 (b)(7)(D), (b)(7)(E), and \n(b)(7)(F)] and Privacy Act exemption (j)(2) [5 U.S.C.\u00c2\u00a7 552a (j)(2)]. The mere acknowledgment of the existence or nonexistence of \nsuch records would reveal confidential informant identities and information, expose law enforcement techniques, and endanger \nthe life or physical safety of individuals. This is a standard response and should not be read to indicate that such records do or do\nnot exist.\nPart 3: General Information: \n(i) Record Searches and Standard Search Policy. The Record/Information Dissemination Section (RIDS) searches for \nreasonably described records by searching systems, such as the Central Records System (CRS), or locations where responsive \nrecords would reasonably be found. The CRS is an extensive system of records consisting of applicant, investigative, \nintelligence, personnel, administrative, and general files compiled by the FBI per its law enforcement, intelligence, and \nadministrative functions. The CRS spans the entire FBI organization, comprising records of FBI Headquarters, FBI Field Offices, \nand FBI Legal Attach\u00c3\u00a9 Offices (Legats) worldwide; Electronic Surveillance (ELSUR) records are included in the CRS. The \nstandard search policy is a search for main entity records in the CRS. Unless specifically requested, a standard search does not\ninclude a search for reference entity records, administrative records of previous FOIPA requests, or civil litigation files. \na. Main Entity Records \u00e2\u0080\u0093 created for individuals or non-individuals who are the subjects or the focus of \nan investigation \nb. Reference Entity Records- created for individuals or non-individuals who are associated with a case \nbut are not known subjects or the focus of an investigation\n(ii) FBI Records. Founded in 1908, the FBI carries out a dual law enforcement and national security mission. As part of this dual \nmission, the FBI creates and maintains records on various subjects; however, the FBI does not maintain records on every \nperson, subject, or entity.\n(iii) Foreseeable Harm Standard. As amended in 2016, the Freedom of Information Act provides that a federal agency may \nwithhold responsive records only if: (1) the agency reasonably foresees that disclosure would harm an interest protected by one \nof the nine exemptions that FOIA enumerates, or (2) disclosure is prohibited by law (5 United States Code, Section \n552(a)(8)(A)(i)). The FBI considers this foreseeable harm standard in the processing of its requests. \n(iv) Requests for Criminal History Records or Rap Sheets. The Criminal Justice Information Services (CJIS) Division \nprovides Identity History Summary Checks \u00e2\u0080\u0093 often referred to as a criminal history record or rap sheet. These criminal history \nrecords are not the same as material in an investigative \u00e2\u0080\u009cFBI file.\u00e2\u0080\u009d An Identity History Summary Check is a listing of \ninformation taken from fingerprint cards and documents submitted to the FBI in connection with arrests, federal employment, \nnaturalization, or military service. For a fee, individuals can request a copy of their Identity History Summary Check. Forms \nand directions can be accessed at www.fbi.gov/about-us/cjis/identity-history-summary-checks. Additionally, requests can be \nsubmitted electronically at www.edo.cjis.gov. For additional information, please contact CJIS directly at (304) 625-5590. \n\nEXPLANATION OF EXEMPTIONS\nSUBSECTIONS OF TITLE 5, UNITED STATES CODE, SECTION 552\n(b)(1) (A) specifically authorized under criteria established by an Executive order to be kept secret in the interest of national defense or foreign \npolicy and (B) are in fact properly classified to such Executive order;\n(b)(2) related solely to the internal personnel rules and practices of an agency;\n(b)(3) specifically exempted from disclosure by statute (other than section 552b of this title), provided that such statute (A) requires that the \nmatters be withheld from the public in such a manner as to leave no discretion on issue, or (B) establishes particular criteria for withholding \nor refers to particular types of matters to be withheld;\n(b)(4) trade secrets and commercial or financial information obtained from a person and privileged or confidential;\n(b)(5) inter-agency or intra-agency memorandums or letters which would not be available by law to a party other than an agency in litigation with \nthe agency;\n(b)(6) personnel and medical files and similar files the disclosure of which would constitute a clearly unwarranted invasion of personal privacy;\n(b)(7) records or information compiled for law enforcement purposes, but only to the extent that the production of such law enforcement records \nor information ( A ) could reasonably be expected to interfere with enforcement proceedings, ( B ) would deprive a person of a right to a \nfair trial or an impartial adjudication, ( C ) could reasonably be expected to constitute an unwarranted invasion of personal privacy, ( D ) \ncould reasonably be expected to disclose the identity of confidential source, including a State, local, or foreign agency or authority or any \nprivate institution which furnished information on a confidential basis, and, in the case of record or information compiled by a criminal law \nenforcement authority in the course of a criminal investigation, or by an agency conducting a lawful national security intelligence \ninvestigation, information furnished by a confidential source, ( E ) would disclose techniques and procedures for law enforcement \ninvestigations or prosecutions, or would disclose guidelines for law enforcement investigations or prosecutions if such disclosure could \nreasonably be expected to risk circumvention of the law, or ( F ) could reasonably be expected to endanger the life or physical safety of any \nindividual;\n(b)(8) contained in or related to examination, operating, or condition reports prepared by, on behalf of, or for the use of an agency responsible for \nthe regulation or supervision of financial institutions; or\n(b)(9) geological and geophysical information and data, including maps, concerning wells.\nSUBSECTIONS OF TITLE 5, UNITED STATES CODE, SECTION 552a\n(d)(5) information compiled in reasonable anticipation of a civil action proceeding;\n(j)(2) material reporting investigative efforts pertaining to the enforcement of criminal law including efforts to prevent, control, or reduce crime \nor apprehend criminals;\n(k)(1) information which is currently and properly classified pursuant to an Executive order in the interest of the national defense or foreign \npolicy, for example, information involving intelligence sources or methods;\n(k)(2) investigatory material compiled for law enforcement purposes, other than criminal, which did not result in loss of a right, benefit or \nprivilege under Federal programs, or which would identify a source who furnished information pursuant to a promise that his/her identity \nwould be held in confidence;\n(k)(3) material maintained in connection with providing protective services to the President of the United States or any other individual pursuant \nto the authority of Title 18, United States Code, Section 3056;\n(k)(4) required by statute to be maintained and used solely as statistical records;\n(k)(5) investigatory material compiled solely for the purpose of determining suitability, eligibility, or qualifications for Federal civilian \nemployment or for access to classified information, the disclosure of which would reveal the identity of the person who furnished \ninformation pursuant to a promise that his/her identity would be held in confidence;\n(k)(6) testing or examination material used to determine individual qualifications for appointment or promotion in Federal Government service \nthe release of which would compromise the testing or examination process;\n(k)(7) material used to determine potential for promotion in the armed services, the disclosure of which would reveal the identity of the person \nwho furnished the material pursuant to a promise that his/her identity would be held in confidence.\nFBI/DOJ",
