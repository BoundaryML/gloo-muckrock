If you request the thumb drive(s) be mailed to your Kingston Springs, TN address rather than retrieving in person, you are also required to cover the cost of shipping. Once the exact amount can be determined, I will notify a detailed cost amount. If electing to receive the data via United States Postal Service, we will mail the thumb drive(s) once the check payment has been received.\r\n\r\n[cid:image005.jpg@01D98E20.CED9ACD0]\r\n[cid:image007.jpg@01D98E20.CED9ACD0]\r\n\r\nThis Office is moving forward with your request and will contact you on or around May 30th to discuss the process you wish to move forward with in receiving your requested documentation.\r\n\r\nFeel free to contact me if you have further questions or concerns before then.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\nKim\r\n\r\nKim Jeffers-Whitaker, SCP\r\nDirector of Human Resource & Risk Management\r\nAnderson County Government\r\n100 N Main St., Room 102\r\nClinton, TN 37716\r\nMain Tel 865.264.6300<tel:865.264.6300>  |  Direct 865.264.6330<tel:865.264.6330>  |  Fax 865.264.6259<tel:865.264.6259>  |  Cell 865.363.6321\r\nkwhitaker@andersoncountytn.gov<mailto:kwhitaker@andersoncountytn.govorg> | Website<https://andersoncountytn.gov/humanresources/> | Facebook<https://www.facebook.com/HRRMofACG/>\r\n\r\nIn every crisis, doubt or confusion, take the higher path - the path of compassion, courage ~ Amit Ray, Author\r\n\r\nConfidentiality Note: The information contained in this e-mail transmission is privileged and confidential and is intended only for the recipient(s) named above.

Since your request does not exceed\r\n700 pages, I have reassigned it to our *first-tier processing queue*.\r\nTaking into consideration our existing backlog, we *estimate* it will take*\r\n39 months* to complete processing.\r\n\r\nRecords transferred to the custody of the National Archives are exempt from\r\nthe fee and fee waiver provisions of the Freedom of Information Act because\r\na fee schedule was in effect prior to enactment. The applicable section\r\nstates that \u201cnothing in this subparagraph shall supersede fees chargeable\r\nunder a statute specifically providing for setting the level of fees for\r\nparticular types of records\u201d (5 U.S.C. 552 (a)(4)(A)(vi)). The relevant fee\r\nstatute authorizes the National Archives \u201cto charge a fee for making or\r\nauthenticating copies or reproductions of materials transferred to the\r\nArchivist\u2019s custody.\u201d (44 U.S.C. 2116(c)). The inability to grant the\r\nrequested fee waiver does not constitute a denial under the terms of the\r\nFreedom of Information Act.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the future, someone from our office will contact you to inform you that\r\na line-by-line review of the case file has been completed. At that point,\r\nyou will have the option to order a copy for a fee of 80 cents per page or\r\nview the record in-person.\r\n\r\n\r\nIf you visit the National Archives at College Park, Maryland, we will save\r\na digital surrogate of the original record (this will be the reviewed copy\r\nthat may include redactions) to a CD and you will be able to view the file*\r\nat no cost*. If you need to use one of our public access computers you will\r\nneed to bring a universal serial bus (USB) drive so that you will be able\r\nto download a copy. You also have the option of bringing your own personal\r\nlaptop that has a CD-Drive in order to copy the file(s) that way.\r\n\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nREBECCA SHARP\r\nArchivist\r\nSpecial Access and FOIA Program (RF)\nNational Archives and Records Administration\r\n\r\n8601 Adelphi Road\r\n\r\nCollege Park, MD 20740-6001\r\n\r\n(301) 837-0372\r\n\r\nrebecca.sharp@nara.gov\r\nwww.archives.gov/research/foia/", "file_text": null, "status": "fix", "tracking_number": "23-F-0434", "date_estimate": null, "price": null}]
